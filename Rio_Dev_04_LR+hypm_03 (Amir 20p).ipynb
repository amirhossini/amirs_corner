It seems to be the start of a new series and I am not sure if it is a debut novel or if this is an author just writing under a new pen name. IF this is a debut novel I have to admit I am totally blown away by this really well developed writing style.  Even if some parts of the storyline itself are predictable and remind me of other novels I read, the reader is still drawn totally into it from the first page, as there enough new and fresh elements added to it. I kind of got an idea how it was going to work out fast  that I have to admit -  but this is not always a bad thing. In this case it let me simply lean back and enjoy the ride as I saw the things develop the way I envisioned them. And the story already gave me a few ideas on how this could be turning out into a series. I will be looking forward into reading more from this author and this series. As I need an answer to the question that has been on my mind since finishing  no spoilers but will there be hair in near future ? #laughing</td><td>I kind of got an idea how it was going to work out fast  that I have to admit - but this is not always a bad thing.

This selection of Christmas tales was full of beautifully written pieces, where the descriptions of winter helped to cool me down on a hot summer day, although I wasn't really filled with the Christmas cheer I was expecting. These traditional tales set in years gone by often reminded me of Dickens. Many of the stories seemed to show how lonely Christmas can be for some; the old man struggling to fit in with his family, the hermit and his pig, the young gambler bankrupt on Christmas Eve, the dying soldier far from home and the wealthy but lonely merchant are just a few examples to be found, along with a good smattering of ghostly apparitions and orphans. They were certainly stories that made me think and I enjoyed this different perspective. Culturally I learned a lot and was certainly glad to make my acquaintance of some of Frances great writers.

To me this collection was less horror than dark sci-fi, a set of straightforward dystopias--interesting concepts, but presented without much emotional or moral complexity. Expect a focus (and often a quite successful focus) on imagery and atmosphere, but less emphasis on character and plot. With a few exceptions, these stories were presented simply enough that I was well-prepared for the twist ending by the time I got there--there just weren't enough plot threads for a given story to have too many possible endings, given the \"gotcha\" format of dystopian sci fi. The combination of these elements meant there wasn't much I found scary in these stories--I wasn't wrapped up in the characters' lives, and I wasn't left wondering and worrying about what was about to happen to them next--the settings are the stars of these stories, not the people who live there. But if you would like to see a lot of colorful (or, occasionally, colorless) bad endings for humanity, then this will be a good collection to check out. There are deadly (but perhaps lonesome?) aliens to see, tainted elixirs to drink, lost songs to hear, and grim and varied worlds to explore.

Both authors create patchwork characters out of inanimate objects, animals, and people parts. Geography plays a large role in separating the species they invent. Characters are repeatedly hacked to pieces and reassembled through magic. Their worlds are populated with strong female characters, often wicked and powerful ones. With a few exceptions, their men are often stupid and ineffectual. You may be asking yourself: Well, what about Wol-vriey's obsession with transgender characters? There's nothing like that in the land of Oz! Well, there you'd be wrong. Baum's Ozma was transgender. She was born a girl, was transformed into a boy to live out most of her childhood before being transformed back into a young girl again and attaining Oz's throne. In Oz, you'll find Glass Cat. In Wol-vriey's Boston Posh, you'll find Glass Horse. Baum has Utensia, a land populated solely with kitchen utensils. In Boston Posh you have a telekinetic race of sentient Forks. Baum gives us the Wheelers, a race of creatures with wheels for hands. Wol-vriey gives us the Mermaids on Motorcycles. Both authors give us creatures made of porcelain, dragons, talking animals, and transmogrification as punishment. Both authors give us kidnapping schemes, riddles, horrible puns, and absurd quests to find bizarre magical objects. Both authors give us automatons and portals to other realms.

There was something about the way the author wrote that had me fixated on what was going to happen next... Dr Hanya, a psychologist for the show is prepped to expose a story that will alter many peoples lives, and test the morals of many people. Pandemonium filled the set when something unexpected occurred, beginning the domino effect. Vivid imagery provides a clear picture of the scenes around the doctor, knowing that there was more to come. With Dr Hanya speaking in the first person, it is easy to establish a connection. Although, unsure whether to like the main character or not. Unfortunately, after the main event, it slowed rapidly. Being questioned by police, videoed, every thing put in front of the public. Catching a glimpse of the ruthless world they we were. The novel switches to another character, Sage, the doctors niece, getting her view on things. Very rare to find well thought out images to go alongside the story, which keeps it entertaining. The story again picks up pace as the consequences of their actions haunts them. No one is safe. Sexual tension between Sage and Robert, the Senators son; and the man who documents everything that happens, he uses his position to push all the boundaries. There is a large amount of dialogue, which at times enables the reader to be immersed into the story. However, I don't feel there was enough action or tension to be called specifically a thriller. Its more about the lives of these different women, and the consequences of their actions. More about the build-up of something else that is about to take place. Everyone is a suspect, no one above positions, and the real chance of someone close to the characters, may be behind it all. The sexual aspect definitely caught my attention, well written and executed. With both Dr Hanya and Sage playing with fire, who could get burned? Consequences of past actions begin to catch up with the characters, and Sage has to fight not too lose control. Manipulation, lies, money and sex are just a game to some. One tip over, and the dominos fall... Knocking anything in its path.

On Friday I talked a bit about Book 0: Prologue from the Shadows of Esteren series. Think of that book as your starter box in Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder or any number of other tabletop RPGs. With a low-fantasy setting, Shadows of Esteren is more effective than most fantasy tabletop games because most of it is very much grounded in a place that feels more real - which makes the supernatural occurrences all the more daunting. Shadows of Esteren Book 1: Universe takes the foundation presented by Prologue and starts to answer more questions - while posing even more challenges along the way. Probably the most interesting aspect to this Universe is how it so eloquently sets everything up. I complimented the original book for being well-written, and Universe does an even better job than its predecessor in immersing the player into this world. Letters, lots of flavor texts and more help to set the stage. The easy comparison is to the old Dungeons & Dragons Ravenloft campaigns, but Shadows of Esteren is far more subtle and reserved. There are things that go bump in the night (known as Feondas). The key is getting the player characters invested in this world, and then getting them to investigate it as well. The truth is often daunting and difficult to ascertain, but the horror themes found within are absolutely worth the time invested into it. The sanity mechanic is something I have seen in a handful of video games (one of my all-time favorite GameCube games was Eternal Darkness), but not implemented very well in tabletop settings - until now. Seriously, the amount of thought that went into this is very impressive. The official blog is quite insightful, with a wide range of topics. It is clear that a lot of effort goes into these, and the results certainly show. I already commented on the excellent writing, but the artwork is arguably the best I have ever seen in a tabletop book. Book 1: Universe is a well-made book by any measure, but it outdoes itself with its art. So what about the game itself? The rules take something of a backseat to the story, which is my personal preference. Character creation is deep and entertaining, and the framework is certainly needed to make sure that the plot progresses while playing, but I never felt like I was restricted by the rules. They were guidelines that helped to ensure things progressed smoothly and made sure everyone had fun. Here the ideas are built around working together to come to a conclusion that makes sense and is hopefully satisfying for everyone involved. This is not a random numbers-driven dice game (in fact the rules generally lean away from those concepts unless absolutely necessary, making the few moments I broke out the dice all that much more impactful). The characters are what drive the story. This is why I mentioned earlier that the bits of flavor early on are what help to establish this world. They also lend themselves to Shadows of Esteren's approach to narration - or the unreliable narrator. A good insanity system requires that there be doubt placed in what is real or not, and that a person has to question if what another is telling them happens to be accurate. These different perspectives help to create a world where trust is not a given and sets a stage where most people do not mean harm - but letting one's guard down at the wrong time might open up the door to those threats that do exist. I touched on the character creation system, which is staggeringly deep. This is more about experiences than class restrictions. That being said, the open ended magic system available to the players really provides a level of flexibility not found in a lot of other games. I will admit that as the one running the games, it kept me on my toes somewhat frequently, but it was a lot of fun. However, given the different feel of Shadows of Esteren, there is a bit of a learning curve for those players who have cut their teeth on some of the better known tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons. Probably the biggest shortcoming of Book 1: Universe is that it clearly is meant to be part of a collective. Like many other tabletop RPG systems, there are different books that fill different roles and it can be near impossible to run a proper campaign without all of the requisite tomes of knowledge. A slightly smaller concern is that in a world with such limited variety (again, no dragons or elves), the setting can feel just a bit mundane at times. The less fantastical nature means that as the one running the campaign, I had to find other types of details to interject in order to keep players properly hooked now and then. The overall quality of Shadows of Esteren Book 1: Universe is undeniable. It is beautiful, well-constructed and tries to approach tabletop gaming by doing something new and different. Some of the concepts will be easier to adopt than others, but it is certainly worth investigating for fans of horror and role-playing.</td><td>A quality RPG that focuses on atmosphere</td><td>2015-03-26</td><td>874</td><td>2015</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>67000052</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2014-03-20</td><td>A2F83G90CXXB7I</td><td>1940120918</td><td>Mary Saad Assel</td><td>Joy Friedlers collection of poems pulls her reader into an interior speculation of her life.

Nancy Frederick consults with clients around the world. They come back to her time and again for good advice not only on their love life but on life in general! Frederick's book,\" Love and Sex Under the Stars,\" first came out two decades ago.  I won't admit when I got MY first copy, but I will say that her advice was spot-on.  Knowing your own love style and your lover's love style makes ALL the difference.  You communicate better and you better understand what each of you NEEDS in order to feel loved and cherished. When I found out that Frederick was working on a revised version of this long standing Bible of Romance, I got on her list because I wanted to get the new version as soon as it was available. The revised version is fabulous.  It is available in paperback and on Kindle.  The book starts with a great explanation of why Venus and Mars are important love planets.  I then looked up Venus and Leo, and Venus and Mars as well as the combination.  Since I already have a previous edition of the book, I knew most of it  but was pleased to learn a few new tidbits. I was also delighted to see Frederick's special brand of humor shining through! What was even more fun was looking up a male friend's info.  He had a birthday coming up and I wanted ideas for the PERFECT gift. Instead of buying a gift I made him two batches of home-made muffins.  He has not stopped raving since. Whether you are entering a relationship, thinking about it, or fully committed, you will find \"Love and Sex Under the Stars\" to be funny, educational and extremely helpful in creating romance and a solid relationship. I highly recommend getting Frederick's book!

Erik (14) and his school friend Edmund spend the 1962 Swedish summer holiday in a wooden, lake-side summerhouse, swimming, rowing, smoking and daydreaming about their teacher Ewa, who has a striking resemblance with movie star Kim Novak. One day Ewa turns up at a village festival nearby with her fianc. Soon after, something terrible happens, as announced from page 1 onward, hanging as a dark cloud and cliff hanger, over the next 100 pages, an event marking the lives of a limited number of people for life, including a police investigator. Hakan Nesser brilliantly describes in laconic terms and dialogues the curious, sometimes cruel mindsets of 14-year old boys, their uncertainties and fears, their daring, posturing and cynicism, and their residual ignorance: Erik struggles with questions he won't ask his friends or parents (who commune in proverbs and homilies; besides, his mum is terminally ill). What is the meaning of Treblinka- Cancer-Love-F***-Death, words Erik invokes when close to tears? However, Nesser follows Erik until he is 49, so it is not a How to Survive as a Boy at 14-book after all. Its surprise ending may not be to everyones liking, but confirms the authors plotting skills. Authentic brand names enhance any books historical correctness, but were cassette players and tapes available in 1962?

In A Debt Requited you really feel for Lacey and the circumstances she is indebted to.  In the beginning, I felt Lacey was a bit delusional when it came to her circumstances and financial well-being at home; but then quickly felt sorry for her once she changed households. Dallin is a man who lives and rules with an iron hand (literally).  A firm believer in Domestic Discipline (along with all the men in the family) and doesnt hesitate to paddle Laceys behind whenever he deems it necessary. Although throughout the story, you feel that Dallin will have a level of compassion for Lacey (at least when he is sharing his thoughts  he doesnt want to hurt her, he feels bad for her sadness, etc).  However, he doesnt do anything to act on these feelings and totally disregards Lacey emotional and physical state.  To the point of callousness at times.  And just when you thought that love was evolving between these two, WHAM!!! here comes the curveball known as Lance. Lance is an interesting character (Im not sure how I feel about him), however I really don't care for his presence in this story.  As such, I hope that Lacey stick to her guns (her thoughts at the end of the story  more specifically the last line.  Ultimately, I would like to see where this story goes.

Much like the historical studies of military developments from Osprey, with which I am quite familiar, or perhaps Jane's studies of various modern military hardware, this ambitious work of only 318 pages gives an overview of all of the various ship types, as well as specific named ships themselves, in addition to the technological advances which made them possible. All of this is generously complemented by colorfully rendered pictures and cut-aways that get one feeling the interior of the ship in intimate detail. While not characterized by long-winded and overly technical text due to the encompassing of over 100 ships into the volume, each vessel is accorded more than a few pages, and the descriptions more than adequately describe the vessel's characteristics, particularly as the temporal layout shows each ship type more or less innovations building upon previous technologies. There is only a very simple table of contents, which requires one to revert to the alphabetical index in the back of the book to locate specific vessels and classes, which does detract from ease of reference, and is a bit of a disappointment in this otherwise extraordinary text.</td><td>Excellent reference for the layman</td><td>2006-12-30</td><td>221</td><td>2006</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>67000086</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>2016-10-16</td><td>A26LO6NNOE4YNU</td><td>1502330822</td><td>Virginia Creason</td><td>This book was definitely a vast improvement from the first.

Each novel seems to focus on a different character and even though some from previous books will pop up, in no way do you feel like your missing out like you can with some books in a series. As its a great series though I do of course recommend reading them all. Through Marlo and her colleagues, we get a closer look into what police divers actually do. Its not very often crime books or a crime television programme will really focus on these important team members in the force, so I found it really interesting just to see how involved they are on cases and what their roles fully entail. The main story line is human trafficking which through Elvie, a fifteen year old girl who was taken from her home and brought to England, we very much see the horrors of what awaits them here. The treatment of the girls by the people that are behind it all is really appalling and my heart really went out to them. KA Richardson manages to create characters that really get into the readers skin. Its almost as if they are our friends or family as they seem so real. The fact that as a reader you develop feelings for these characters just goes to show what a talented writer she is. Already I cant wait to see who she is going to introduce us to next and to what enthralling case they could be working on. Time To Play is yet another heart wrenching and gripping read. The crimes as well as the villains never fail to shock and horrify me. If you haven't read any of the books in this series then why not as you are seriously missing out.

Two things should be mentioned right away: first, that this is a book of science fiction art, not fantasy (there are no dragons, no unicorns, no elves), and second, that with the exception of a few science fiction movie posters, the art featured within are book covers and magazine covers. This book itself is a work of art. It's large, it's heavy (printed on thick glossy paper), it's very colorful and has very fancy graphic designs. The layout is easy to see, eye-catching, and well spaced. Some of the featured covers are full-page. Most pages have two or three covers, a few have four. In other words, the pictures are never crowded together, and remain large enough to show detail. Many of the covers are astounding. There are assorted rockets, saucers, aeroplanes, even a few flying globes. There are furry aliens, tentacled aliens, winged aliens, reptilian aliens, aquatic aliens, some tiny humanoid aliens. Heroes in skintight clothing, heroes in coverall jumpsuits, heroes in metallic spacemechs, heroes in Roman Centurion gear (go figure), heroes in clanky armorlike spacesuits. The women, especially in the earlier pulps and books, tend to be either scantily clad or in skintight clothing, and most are in various states of distress (being carried off by aliens). There are vistas of deserts, oceans, mountain ranges, desolate moonscapes, fantastic alien forests, fabulous spaceports. Many moons hang in the sky, and fantastic ringed planets. Among the magazines included are Analog, Asimov's, Fantasy & Science Fiction, Argosy, Astounding, Amazing Stories, Planet Stories, Science Wonder Stories, Locus. And more. Book covers range from forgotten novellas to bestselling classics. Movie posters from B-movie creature features to contemporary blockbusters. There really is a lot of art in this book. The narrative, which is actually extensive, mostly follows the history of the sci-fi magazines and their circulation. The data is informative, but when the art is this beautiful, you won't be reading the small print except to see who did the drawing anyway. You'll lose yourself in this book! There is only one reason I took one star from the review: some of the art is not identified. The publishers really ought to be ashamed of themselves for overlooking this, in an art book of all things. The entries are identified (although some of the artists' names have been lost, the publisher or sources are named), but the graphics of the cover (of this book) and the chapter introductions are not identified. Shame, shame! The chapter introduction plates are breathtaking, as are the inside-cover and dustjacket art. This is a book of dreams and imagination.

Now he can now be seen as an exceptionally gifted draughtsman and artist. His favorite subjects were the rough manly men of his native Finland, as Touko knew from an early age that men interested him more than women. His talents were further honed by art study in Helsinki. He found success in the Finnish advertising industry but secretly continued creating his increasingly erotic drawings of hyper-masculine men. In 1957 he submitted some drawings to the American magazine Physique Pictorial and the \"Tom of Finland\" legend was born. By the late '60s Tom's \"dirty drawings\" became the standard for gay art, and Tom's Men a template for a new gay masculinity. Tom's art continues to play an important role in promoting self-confidence, positive self-image and openness in the gay community. TOM OF FINLAND: LIFE AND WORK OF A GAY HERO by F. Valentine Hooven III is a powerful statement about this always controversial an now completely respected artist.  \"My whole life long I have done nothing but interpret my dreams of ultimate masculinity, and draw them.\"--Tom of FinlandHe's the first name in erotic gay art. Tom of Finland's painstaking, perfect pencil drawings of macho, muscular men--big in every way that counts--influenced gay culture around the globe. As playful as they are sexual, as cheeky as they are fetishistic, Tom of Finland's works celebrate gay archetypes like construction workers and cops, soldiers and sailors, lumberjacks and leathermen, bikers and badasses. With an extensive biography, eye-opening photos and an authoritative collection of drawings, Tom of Finland: Life and Work of a Gay Hero by F. Valentine Hooven III brings this brilliant body of work to life.

So many times, an author cannot switch from one character's story to the other without confusing the reader, but Alix Nichols skillfully switches from one story to another, then to another geographical location and still connects it all.  The common connection is, of course, the Bistro. I eagerly await her next novel!</td><td>Great read! Great stories!  Great characters!

Her system breaks the teaching into 15 to 20 minute blocks of time which could happen three or four times per week. She concentrates her lessons on the Recorder which go back to the 14th century, and of course that choice is the cheapest way to go for a musical instrument. Pick one up for a few bucks, and if your child shows some aptitude, you can progress to anything else in the next few years. What is a sure thing about this way of teaching children is the pleasure and excitement that they will get from producing music using this method. There is a list of resource suppliers, and her own website which I found to be of great value.

G. Wells classic science fiction/horror novel The Island of Doctor Moreau explains that the text of the book is the account of Edward Prendick, an Englishman who, after departing on a Pacific Ocean voyage, went missing for about a year. When the ship hes traveling on goes down, Prendick escapes in a life boat, which is discovered a few days later by a passing ship, the Ipecacuanha. On board this ship is a mysterious Mr. Montgomery, who is travelling with a load of African wildlife and a strangely deformed assistant. When the captain of the Ipecacuanha reaches Montgomerys destination, a remote and little-known island, he refuses to take Prendick any further and kicks him off the ship, despite Montgomerys objections. Now marooned on this isolated isle, Prendick is granted a modicum of hospitality, but he knows his presence is not welcome there because of secret goings-on that are kept hidden from him. He soon learns that the man in charge on the island is one Dr. Moreau, an expat Londoner and biologist who has fled civilization so that he may carry out his ethically questionable experiments. I have no doubt that when this book was originally published in 1896, its audience was simultaneously terrified and delighted by its shockingly unique premise. For many of todays readers, however, the cat has unfortunately been let out of the bag. Wells spends the first half of the book playing hide and seek with the islands creatures, but any reader whos aware of the movie adaptations of this story already knows what horrific surprises lie in wait. Once Prendick encounters Moreau the book gets a lot better, as it starts to get into the scientific and philosophical aspects of the story. I would have preferred a little more discourse between Prendick and Moreau, and a little less chasing each other around the island. Nevertheless, there are a good many suspenseful scenes that keep the reader thrilled and chilled. The science may have been a bit implausible by the standards of the nineteenth-century, but not entirely impossible by those of the twenty-first, and the issues of scientific and medical ethics are even more relevant in todays age of genetic modification than at the time the book was published. Moreau, the arrogant scientist who dares to play God, is a fascinating character, as is his enforcer Montgomery, an alcoholic so disillusioned with human society that he feels more at home with the beasts. I recently read Mary Shelleys Frankenstein, and The Island of Doctor Moreau covers many of the same issues. Though a man of science may have the ability to tamper with the natural order of life and the universe, does he have the right? Is the infliction of pain justified when it advances scientific knowledge? Does the scientist have a responsibility to his creations, just as the father has to his son? If man is capable of bending nature to his will, does this call into question the existence of God? Wells tackles all these issues more successfully than Shelley, and whats more important, his book isn't boring. This novel is first and foremost an adventure tale, but Wells as usual elevates his work far above typical genre fiction by injecting his narrative with thought-provoking philosophical inquiry. If youve seen the various film versions of this novel, Wells original text is still well worth reading. If you're not familiar with the movie versions at all, then you're in for an astonishing wild ride.</td><td>A creepy thriller with philosophical bite</td><td>2014-06-12</td><td>583</td><td>2014</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>67000123</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2015-07-02</td><td>A2P9EZV6AU8SEG</td><td>1941077064</td><td>Natalie picone</td><td>After the end of part one of the Fallen I was more than excited for Part two.

The book is organized into six different categories of love that will presumably prevent a marriage from ending in divorce.  Though this is an admirable goal, I'm not sure how this book will accomplish such a feat. My primary critique of the book is that it provides nothing new to the catalog of Christian marriage books.  I've read many of them, and the Rosberg's contribution is largely a retread of many others.  In terms of the book title, I'm now sure how this book is supposed to provide any specific advice for avoiding divorce.  Its rather generic nature might suggest that a more appropriate title choice would have been \"How to Have a Good Christian Marriage.\"  To that end, their effort is respectable but largely unremarkable. To their credit, the Rosbergs manage to navigate the tricky waters of co-authorship rather successfully.  The interplay from one voice to the other was not choppy as is often the case with co-authors.  They also told a number of engaging stories, both from their own life together and from many couples who have been counseled by Gary.  The story-telling component was the most meaningful and useful part of the book. Ultimately, there was nothing in \"Divorce-Proof Your Marriage\" with which I disagreed.  And the presentation of the material was fine.  The book just never really grabbed me in any significant way.  If you're looking for a Christian book to really solidify and improve your marriage, I'd recommend Gary Thomas' \"Sacred Marriage\" or Gary Chapman's \"The Five Love Languages\" instead.</td><td>Nothing new...</td><td>2007-02-18</td><td>302</td><td>2007</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>67000127</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2014-01-12</td><td>A3R37SWBOBDL92</td><td>1493761056</td><td>Gary Covington PhD</td><td>During the early 1950's we, as youngsters, could not wait for the next Saturday's Buck Rogers sequel at the movie theater.

Just listening to him in the mornings does, I believe, get me more excited about the day to come, and the more excited I am, the more I can get done. There's a lot to recommend about Anthony Robbins. On the other hand, this particular product--Get the Edge--is a slight letdown. He concentrates too much on anecdotes, and pulls material from his workshops (usually anecdotes, too), and jumps from topic to topic instead of really going in depth. For instance, one CD is relationships, the next is health and fitness and the one after that is finance. Personal Power II is a more extensive, in-depth presentation, and if you're new to Anthony Robbins I suggest getting that over this. (They cost just about the same.) About Robbins' using these CDs to sell his other courses and seminars, etc., I have to say: I don't doubt that he'd like to sell his other stuff, but I really do believe he's genuine and sincere in his efforts, here. He mentions his other products from time to time, but does not pitch them directly. If it is a sell (and of course it is), it's a very soft sell. In short, Robbins is exciting and fun to listen to. This set has value just because of that. However, because he covers a wide range of topics, and covers them quickly and mostly anecdotally, this particular set leaves something to be desired. His other line, Personal Power II, is more in-depth and therefore, in my opinion, is a better overall value.</td><td>Fun and High-Energy (...if a little shallow and unfulfilling)</td><td>2006-06-27</td><td>264</td><td>2006</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>67000132</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2016-11-30</td><td>A320N286BCDAN8</td><td>1940269970</td><td>Allen B.</td><td>Experiencing the dirt and grime of Roy Goble's boyhood working among rusted out car parts is similar to finding hidden long-term wealth in messy relationships both near and far.

Author Sandra Masters sums up book five her series which takes place in London 1816 by this statement: Can Samanthas barriers fall with more kisses? Can Raven be released from his deathbed vow? Chapter one opens with action The decision to walk to the gala had been a colossal mistake. The Tenth Duke of Ravensmere ducked into the shadows. Seven against one not good odds. Those who follow this series already know the well-developed characters and great story telling. Whether you start with book one or book five you will travel back into a period of time where romance was divine and acts played out in the bedroom were expressions of ones heart and soul. Let me draw you into the story with a delicious romance from chapter thirty three: Raven growled as she screamed his name over and over again and considered it a benediction. Then and there, he knew there would never be any other woman for him. Her every reaction became an aphrodisiac. He prepared to ascend into sublime bliss, plunged his manhood into her again and again, and before he could exercise any control, released his seed. Each thrust seemed to reward them with multiple orgasms. His voice roared in strong satisfaction, desperate to breathe in gulps of air. She was velvet. He was iron. The look of passion on her sweet face pleasured him. This experience didn't disappoint. Not what he expected, and perhaps too much more. Raven felt her muscle tighten around him and contract, tighten, and then bind him yet again. She coiled around his shaft. Paradise attained. He didn't want the moment to end. What man would? After a few long moments, he rolled off her and brought her close to him, their bodies naked and moist from their lovemaking. I hope I wasn't too heavy. Admittedly, I dealt with a few unexpected issues. He kissed her forehead and fondled her silken hair. Raven gazed at her face when she leaned back in repose, skin kissed by the moonlight, her lips rose-colored and lust-swollen. Her hair now pooled into strands of red curls wound in laziness and reminded him of a burning forest fire as it crested. The flames of the fireplaces glowing embers cast a color spell of reds, orange and yellow on her tresses, radiating and beckoning his fingers to romp through. He knew the touch of it would feel like silken threads. Fascinated, he stared as her finger teased away ward tendril away. I invite you to enjoy this book along with the entire Duke Series by romance author Sandra Masters. I am enjoying the entire series. I, Theodocia McLean endorse One Night With A Duke as a refreshing Regency Romance set in the 1800s.

The pace gives readers a chance to savor the story as the join in the hunt that includes past hauntings with present day spirits.

Here are a few of the ones in Jonah Boyd: The narrator's car is in the shop (this is 1969) and she mentions having to deal with catalytic converters.  Catalytic converters weren't even in use in 1969. She mentions that her apartment complex parking lot filled with Olds Cutlass's and Ford LTDs on weekends.  That's unlikely too, since both cars were both produced in fairly low numbers at the time. She mentions one of the brothers in the story reading a Hustler magazine (again, this is 1969).  Publication of Hustler magazine began in 1974. She mentions taking the battery out of a wall clock whose ticking was annoying her.  Battery-powered quartz clocks that \"tick\" were not marketed until the late 70s.  Clocks then were either electric (and they hummed) or they were manually wound (these ticked). Finally she describes an engineering professor who came unglued after a \"cloverleaf\" interchange he designed collapsed and killed 17 people.  First, university faculty do not do design work such as that for any highway department.  Second, individuals do not do design work such as that (teams do).  Third, design failures such as she describes do not (and have never) occurred. There are at least three typos that whoever proofread the text missed. It's not a bad story, but I sure wouldn't buy the book.

Joiner</td><td>The saddest part about Gill Robb Wilson's life is that Flying magazine did not keep copies of his columns. His \"Airman's World\" is the main reason I read the magazine and the book that is being offered for sale here is the one remaining remnant of his life. I particularly remember one Wilson contribution about people at an airshow. The accompanying photograph showed a crowd of people being held back by a restraining rope, but with all eyes fixed on the sky as they watched the planes wheel and circle and fly like birds in precision. Wilson described these groundlings as \"nameless, fameless, grounded, grieving, for the chance that passed them by. By this he meant that many, if not most, people in the photograph did not learn to fly for one reason or another. He suggested that some of them there would have become pilots had health or misfortune not interfered with their plans. But then he asked the rhetorical question: are airmen who realize their dream more of a pilot than people who are pilots in their heart? Wilson said no. Then, abruptly, he ended his column with these words: \"Ashes of life's aspirations are not signs of foul decay, But the hallmarks of a message that a man has passed this way.\" That phrase became a byline of mine as I went through first one career that involved flying and then another that didn't. I have shared it many times with people who were depressed or sad. \"Look,\" I would say, \"just because you didn't realize your dream doesn't mean that all is lost. It simply means that along this way came a human being trying to do the best he could. Pick yourself up, friend, and get on with life.\" The radio talk show host Dennis Prager puts it differently: he says the secret to happiness is to have no personal expectations. Now before people accuse me of setting the crossbar low, that isn't what I said. Dr. Prager and I say set the crossbar of life high but don't spend time worrying about whether you will make it over the top. Just do the best you can and be surprised and happy when you succeed.

However, I feel the author only spent a small amount of time on \"Life Driven Purpose\" specifically.  Most of the book is logical arguments from an atheist point of view on why there is no god.  I do not have a problem with what he wrote, but like a lot of atheist authors he spent more time talking about why there is no god than about the titled theme of the book.  I see a lot of authors do this.  I wish he could make the point, move on, and talk about the subject.  If the book had been titled or described as a book on atheism polemics it would have been much more accurate.

In this book, you can learn the importance of the fight of young people for healthy sexual activity, and the negative neurotic damage done by this society's anti-sexual repression.  You can read this in relatively short articles Reich wrote on a variety of topics collected here under this name. This book is the most approachable introduction to Reich's positive contributions on the role of sexuality in capitalist society, on destruction of compulsory sex morality, and about what a new freer less pathological world would be like.  Most of his other books were reedited in the 1940s and 1950s and smothered with the mumbo jumbo of his \"orgone biopathy\" theories. These theories were more of an expression of Reich's mental breakdown under the hammer blows of Stalinism, Fascism, and Americanism, than anything resembling science. Perhaps this book has less of that because almost all of Reich's works were banned by the US government during the 1950s through the late 1960s. This was the first one of his books legally published (I remember reading bootleg editions of his work before then) after that ban and might have less of that stuff for that reason. Whatever people misremember about the 1960s, it was quite revolutionary to see this book with this author and this title in bookstores in 1968!

This is a 5-piece set for one person that includes a coffee spoon, table spoon, table knife, salad fork and table fork. This flatware is an investment (families or those who entertain should consider 12 sets to have enough as pieces get lost over time and patterns get discontinued), but this is a high quality weighty 18/10 stainless steel set that should last a lifetime. This design is understated with simple clean lines, but it's classic and elegant too. It has a brilliant shine as opposed to a satin finish. The pieces are balanced and a pleasure to hold as they're a heavy weight and are smooth and rounded with nice curvatures. Mepra Natura is easy to care for as its dishwasher safe and doesn't require polishing. Mepra Natura is a solid and lovely set perfect for everyday use and company too. Italian sizing seems to vary somewhat from what's customary in the USA, but the Natura pieces are close in size and feel natural to me. For total length, I measure 9\" for the table knife, 6-1/8\" for the coffee spoon, 6-3/4\" for the table spoon, 6-3/4\" for the salad fork and 8\" for the table fork. The coffee spoon handle feels shorter to me than a regular teaspoon, and the table spoon handle seems sized in between a teaspoon and soup spoon. I love the table spoon as the handle length and bowl feel perfect to me for eating everything from cereal to soups. The sizing of the fork handles feel pretty typical, and I find the tines to be a comfortable length for eating. The table knife has fine tooth serrations and feels sharper than my stainless steak knives in another brand and cuts meat well. This Mepra Natura is a beautiful quality set of Italian stainless steel flatware that feels natural and comfortable to use and is an all occasion style. Definitely recommended.</td><td>Simple But Classic 18/10 Stainless Steel Flatware Designed And Made In Italy- Perfect For Everyday Use And Entertaining</td><td>2016-10-01</td><td>331</td><td>2016</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>67000159</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2014-09-10</td><td>AD4AFVNFH842X</td><td>B00KMXDQ1A</td><td>PattyH</td><td>I bought this book knowing it was part of a series.

This is a story about a beautiful young woman named Kree who was in love with two different men. She loved them both but in different ways. Vincent was the man she loved and lusted after, while Tommy has been a constant person in her life. Tommy has been in love with Kree since they were children. I LOVED Tommy, he was always there for Kree when she needed someone. Because this book is mafia related there are some violent scenes. Some of these scenes took me completely by surprise. I found myself scared for Kree when certain things happened to her. There was always something going on and that kept me completely interested with the characters and the story line. I gave this book a 3 in the heat level. There were a few loves scenes that I felt could have been a bit hotter and drawn out a bit more but I did enjoy what was offered nonetheless. Near the end there was a HUGE twist that I NEVER saw coming, it threw me for a loop I tell you. Believe me when I say, there is NO WAY youll see that coming. Im not sure what to think of the ending because we never do find out if Kree will end up with Vincent or Tommy. My guess would be Tommy and hes the one I feel she should be with.

This lovely volume, put together as part of a show at the International Center of Photography back in 2012, is a riveting look at the life and work of the man who basically invented tabloid journalism. Opening with the aforementioned excerpt, Murder continues with a reproduction of Rosa Reilly's piece on Weegee as a free lance cameraman from Popular Photography in 1937. Having provided snapshot presentations of Weegee-as-perceived-then, the book then provides five different essays by contemporary writers (including the editor) on how a man called Arthur Fellig turned himself into a brand. Eddy Portnoy's piece provides what biographical information is available on the photographer, and works to fill in the gaps of his early life on the lower East side by providing alternate contemporary accounts of what that life might have looked like, while Carol Squiers explains the historical context of gangland violence that gave Weegee so much material to work with. Interspersed amongst these essays are four \"dossiers\" of photos, gorgeously reproduced, in which the original images are frequently shown in juxtaposition with reproductions of the newspaper articles they appeared in. Arthur Fellig was a fascinating figure, and as far as I know the only photographer to inspire both an episode of The X-Files and a Jake Gyllenhaal film. offers both a fantastic tribute to his work and insight into the insanity of his life.</td><td>Every murder a masterpiece</td><td>2016-01-10</td><td>280</td><td>2016</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>67000169</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2015-01-05</td><td>A3CKS86D7WICQ3</td><td>1626492301</td><td>B.</td><td>Liberty and Other Stories is a remarkable telling of the various backgrounds and evolutions of the crew of the Shadowless (Byron Kaes aethership), who were introduced to us in Prosperity. Through Piccadilly, Mr. Hall gave us expertly delivered teases and glimpses into their respective pasts, which were just enough to make me insanely curious about how they all came to be in the skytown in the first place. This assortment of hearsay, correspondence, and recollections provides some of those answers. As usual, Mr. Hall has proven himself to be an exceptional writer, bedecking the journey with subtle moments of insight almost carelessly, their influence often lingering in the aftermath. Each story can be read independently of the other, but I recommend reading them all, as the rest of the narratives and content, with the exception of Shackles, all add tremendously to the reading of both Prosperity and the final story, Liberty. Shackles explains how Ruben Crowe met, and fell for, the recently fallen crime prince of Gaslight, Milord. While it wasn't my favorite of the four, it is still interesting for both everything we learn about Milord and the effect that information, as well as the man himself, has on Ruben. We also find out why Ruben broke with the Church and see more of the workings of Milords world as a whole. Shackles contains one explicit sexual interaction (for those in need of warning) and seems to be primarily designed to answer questions raised in Prosperity, as neither Ruben nor Milord play a direct role in the happenings of Liberty. Squamous with a Chance of Rain describes how Miss Jane Grey, navigatress of Shadowless and friend of Captain Byron Kae, began her journey towards insanity, addiction, and unapologetic depravity. I like Jane tremendously, and was very glad to finally have more of her history, which was only glanced over before. Told in a succession of one-sided correspondence between Jane and a recently married former companion from Miss Githers Finishing School (which must have been quite an institution!), Squamous illustrates the rapid progression of Janes curse from its inception. I thought this was the funniest of the offerings, and cackled repeatedly over Janes sharp wit and ready use of proper speech for the discussion of some very improper notions. Next, we are treated to bonus content in the form of journal entries from Mrs. Miranda Lovelace, the first aethermancer. These abbreviated entries are scientifically fascinating and highlight Mr. Halls knowledge of all manner of subjects, as well as his imaginative use of it in his writing. The journal itself is a lens on a great catalyst, setting many things in motion and underscoring why the inevitable marriage of science and politics should be regarded with wariness, if not absolute terror. It is also the story of the birth of Liberty. While all of these tales are presented in unique and clever ways, none struck me as more pure, heartfelt, and wondrous as Cloudy Climes and Starless Skies. This is my absolute favorite of the collection, and I was completely enchanted and thoroughly won over yet again by Byron Kae. Perfectly balanced between past and present with the inclusion of commentary from Piccadilly, Cloudy Climes begins as sweetly as anything I have ever read and is an expansive recounting of Byron Kaes life up to the point of its telling. I really cant do this selection proper justice by adding anything else, except to say that I think they are one of the best characters Ive ever read. And Piccadilly, too. The final story in the collection brings everyone, with the exception of Ruben and Milord, together for a battle of survival on the previously mentioned skytown called Liberty. It is the culmination of an intricate tangle of happenings and details and is potentially dizzying in scope, although it really isnt. Told in flashbacks, declassified court documents, and testimony current to the story, it should be read in order to fully appreciate all the action and intrigue to its true potential. While there is certainly a degree of caution present in Liberty, a delightfully substantial amount of testimony was removed for reasons of modesty or decency of the court, giving plenty of well-timed levity to the proceedings. Liberty and Other Stories has something for just about everyone: suspense, a little horror, adventure, humor, and romance. It is filled with tales of loss, hope, and, best of all, love, and all the frustratingly beautiful chaos that goes along with it. Even without the other stories, I found the unvarnished intimacy in Cloudy Climes and Starless Skies to be downright breathtaking. All of the Prosperity covers are gorgeous, as well, and the artwork for the individual stories in Liberty and Other Stories should definitely not be missed.

For a start, her mother was mentally unbalanced. Germaine reveals that when she bought home a boy friend, her mother would often open the front door wearing a pair of underpants on her head and nothing else but a suntan. Her mother \"used words as ammunition, not for communication.\" This book is Germaine's search for the true identity of her father. To hide his illegitimate birth, her father wove a web of falsehoods around his early life. He was always distant with Germaine, and never gave her a proper hug. Feeling suicidal she once fell over a cliff, and it is ironic she was only saved by her father's coat she was wearing when it caught on a snag. There are dreary false trails and much padding in this book. Germaine's self-pity gets a bit much to take. Her vinegary nature must be in part a result of her family situation. At the end of the book I read,someone had pencilled in \"so what.\" An apt comment.</td><td>Germaine's crazy family revealed</td><td>2006-02-13</td><td>177</td><td>2006</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>67000175</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2016-03-18</td><td>A278ULI1W4CMGC</td><td>B005QPE64K</td><td>LJK</td><td>Recipes are great, however basic or fundamental cooking in not covered.</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>2016-03-18</td><td>11</td><td>2016</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>67000176</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2013-09-23</td><td>A2QLT5PSAEIXS6</td><td>1890785407</td><td>Becky Whitaker</td><td>I so can't wait to see what happens in book 2.

Burying it deep within a hole he hopes that the right people will find it before it's too late. Taken by the Russians and placed in a cell the American will be interrogated or worse. Laptop found, information not there but the American is now a hostage. A young Russian student with a brilliant future has the answers to finding out more than most people would want to know. Imagine a program and the ability to read anyone's emails, delete them and more. Mikhail Salenko is a Russian Spy of the highest caliber and quite adept at his craft. Imagine obtaining a network surveillance system with the capability of spying on anyone's emails, at any time. NIIS is the system and obtaining his PHD from MIT he managed to obtain this system where he can intercept emails, copy them, modify them and delete them. Under the guise of wanting to use this system for his startup business he got away with it. Imagine stating he owned a security company that searched for breaches in his client's systems and then stole their information. Checking on these breaches and stealing their data for the Russians and then selling what they did not use on the black market.  But, our young genius was a deep cover agent know to his comrades as Q. Hoping and excited to be working with Master Spy N the author allows the reader to get to know both spies even if it is just for a brief nano second. A Russian Major and an Iranian General are having a conversation linked to the kidnapping of the American. The final data communicated deleted and the information stored on his drive being handled the only thing left is for them to decide what do with him. Each party questioning the other and the Russians wanting to stay in control while the Iranian inquires on his tactics. However, the Iranian is quite astute and realizes that obliterating files sent to the CIA cannot be easy but he also knows about the deep cover agents that are hiding in plain sight you might say in the United States. Discussing what will happen when they learn of his disappearance did not seen to ruffle any of the edges of the Russian. Competition seems to be the name of part of this game, as the Russians want to test whether their technology is superior to our stealth technology. The Iranian owns and operates a weapons plant and the production of weapons-grade uranium he hopes will triple and no longer be kept a secret. Purpose: to let the world know that Iran is a nuclear threat. Just who is this American and why pay a king's ransom to Russia for him still remains to be seen? As the players come into view and the kidnapped victim is revealed we learn more about a deep covert operative who seems to be playing two sides of the fence. Victim tortured and the Russians behind it hoping to learn more about what was stored on his hard drive need to change course before they can strike as something unexpected changes the complexion of the attack. Fast-forward to Special Agent Ron Weiss concerned about Intel on a hard drive and emails from our kidnapped victim, Dr. Thomas Sean Scully Jr. a civilian field operative for operation Bloodhound. Intel on Fordow nuclear plans it what is of prime concern to all parties involved. But, in order for the Russians to succeed in their mission they cannot allow anyone to learn of their failure to keep the young Doctor and the fact that the Israeli's are now involved. With the help of an operative from the Mossad they manage to get the young doctor foiling part of the Iranian/Russian plan. Imagine these two countries tied together by the nuclear knot. Scary to say the least. But, someone in the United States government has partnered with them and now its is up to the Watchman and Cris De Nero and his team to uncover the rest as we learn of the link in the White House and which top level person is really part of the Russian Spy team. How can someone infiltrate themselves into the White House as part of its staff, work with the Vice President and go undetected? So, what is the prime purpose of all this: The newest remote detection devices capable of testing radioactive emissions in the atmosphere. Imagine at the age of 23 being employed as an engineer, soldier and spy for our country. The author explains in detail the Intel, the training and nature of covert work which because it is covert, secret and highly sensitive I cannot divulge much more. As we meet Cris De Nero the star of the Watchman of Ephraim and Signs of War by bestselling author Gerard deMarigny, we learn more about the involvement of other members of the doctor's family and the problems involved in trying to rescue him. Running the Watchman, a counter terrorism firm they hope Cris and his team will finally rescue the doctor and get to the bottom of much more as you will learn. But, as the senior Skully's prepare to celebrate a birthday four Russians linked to the Russian Mafia are monitoring their every move. Describing in detail their affiliations, who the Reznik family is and their connections, current status and positions will send chills down anyone's spine. Reznik is smart, devious, and ruthless and in control of a lot of the criminal activity once run by two other gangs. Just who is on the double side of a huge deep cover fence will surprise the government when they realize this person is hiding in plain sight. \"N\" is considered the most dangerous and \"Q\" is a technological genius providing the Intel needed for their missions and proud to be working with N.  But, let's not forget the deep cover cop who is Z and backup for N. As the Russians try to strong arm Tom Skully Sr. into doing their dirty work in order to get his son back, De Nero and his team are working hard to foil their operation. When he learns about Tom's disappearance and understands that a simple email not delivered would set off some red flags the team of the Watchman is in action. The author introduces each member and elaborates by telling us about them, their jobs and responsibilities so that anyone who did not read the first two De Nero novels will be caught up on no time after reading page 70. One double agent baits another and the end result might be a stalemate. One agent on our side is lost after alerting his boss about the missing American not realizing she is behind some of what happened. Added into the mix is one corrupt police detective who is part of the Russian team and has fooled the police for many years. But, let's meet some of the players who want to take them down as Michelle Wang VP of Intelligence Services for the Watchman is enlisted by Ron Weiss to stop what his boss is about to do. But, the end result is not always what you expect as the double agent does more than just double cross and Weiss winds up dead. Meanwhile Mossad operative Cindy is protecting our young Doctor. Things take on a different turn as two attempts are made to kidnap Cheryl Skully. The first is foiled by Cris and the second even though she is under his protection succeeds. Imagine being kidnapped near an underground uranium enrichment facility? Imagine the Russians missile battalion your captors and they have a missile battery close by. Cheryl Skully is taken by the Russian Mobsters and when Ron Weiss the CIA agent in charge of recruiting him alerts his boss he is killed. Michelle Wang was about to obtain the incriminating video of his capture when things turn sour. But, she is sharp, smart and what happens to our double agent cop you won't believe until you read it for yourself. Tom Skully Sr. is the link or key to the Russian/Iranian operations. Working as a deliveryman for Puritan his job would be to deliver absorbent pads from a company already being watched by the FBI. But, the pads are not ordinary pads found on meat they have a little something extra that would cost many their lives. Ultimate purpose of this mission: to create a situation where the world finally views Iran as a nuclear power. Skully is threatened by his boss a Mr. Pearlman and things get out of hand in a big way for not only Skully but for some of his friends working for this man too. But, with the help of Johnny F the Russians Michelle would be able to stop a lethal killer and turn the tables in our favor but for how long? Russia and Iran linked together and the Russian mob all hoping to defeat the US. In order to insure that Skully would make the deliveries they kidnapped his wife and son. But, just how Cris and his team take down this spy and destroy what Iran/Russia have planned is something you will have to read for yourself. The action is fast paced, the drama is high and the end result will keep you guessing as to the final outcome. A plan so well executed on author Gerard deMarigny could write it. You won't believe the startling ending. Players in place, and let's not forget the Israelis are now involved and the US is teaming with them to stop what would cause WWIII for sure. When the Vice President learns he has a traitor in his midst will he believe Cris and help take N down? What happens when Cris is in danger and one of his team members is missing? Archangel head Scipio is ready and the endgame is near but what really happens to him and why? What happens to the Mossad agent and will everyone come back alive? Will they rescue Tom Jr. in time or will it be too late/ Will Cris get the VP and President on board before it's too late for everyone? What will the final result be and will American RISE TO THE CALL or will they fall? One blockbuster novel filled with betrayals, deceits, lies and a high degree of realism and research into the story line and plot. Read the ending. You decide who wins.

As this is an urban fantasy, we met our main characters in the first installment. So this is not a standalone, you need to read the books in order to be in the know of what is going on. So if you haven't read the first book, A Time Apart, stop reading now because this review may contain minor spoilers. Still with me? Alrighty. So the first installment culminated in a big event... namely Oliva being made vampire. This book picks up where the first left off where our couple have tied themselves together and are starting Olivia's new immortal life. The pacing of this book was reminiscent of the first installment, in that the first 60% of the book meandered along over a short period of time where we watch Olivia and William hanging out in the restored castle, building their relationship and learning to cope with Olivia's new status as a vampire. Something is not quite right with Oliva's transformation. There is a darkness that appears in her at times, which confounds both Olivia and William because neither are sure of the cause or consequences. There was a lot of learning going on for both of our characters... and we spent a good deal of time learning about William's history. Man, I knew William was a tortured hero, but I didn't quite grasp the horror he endured as a new vampire. While his tale was hard to read at times, it did create a stronger empathetic connection to William's character. Olivia, on the other hand, started to hit my annoying heroine buttons. She acted shrewish toward William, storming off at the slightest argument and getting jealous over women he was with before he met her. The pace of the story did start to pick up in the last quarter... almost to the point that it felt like it was going in fast forward. Each new chapter started weeks or months later... and it seemed like we missed out on some events that would have provided some action and anticipation into the story. The vast majority of this story takes place with Oliva and William staying in or on the castle grounds, so I would have liked to see them venture out a little more. I was hoping this installment was where we were going to see the story pick-up, but we are still learning in this book about our character's past and an ancient prophecy which appears to be coming true. The book ends with another big event which provides a good jumping off point for the rest of the series. 3.5 stars / 2 flames.

He hopes by doing so, he can eradicate diseases and extend people's lifespans. He is then taken back in time 30 years via the story of Dr. Carl Stanley. A scientist who lost his daughter at the age of 10 to cancer, and had now created a serum that promoted self healing, even in fatal cases. Although an idealist, Dr. Stanley is working with unsavory men to get the funding for his research. Men that could care less about the healing aspects, except as it pertains to making the perfect weapon. The perfect weapon ends up being Marie, an infant Dr. Stanley found abandoned in a dumpster on his way to the research facility. Along with the nine other baby boys, she is injected daily with the serum and trained to be deadly. When she is pushed too far and loses everything she cares for, the perfect weapon they wanted, will also be the thing they should fear the most. This was an absolutely gripping thriller from beginning to end. While some found the beginning a bit slow, I actually found it necessary to the plot. It's one of those slow burns that ignites midway through, filled with suspense and action, as well as many unsuspecting twists and turns. While many of my reviews point out twists and turns, to be perfectly honest, not many of them are actually unsuspected. I'll admit, I tend to over analyze a bit too much when reading. This one definitely caught me off guard with several unforeseen things which kept me engrossed throughout the book's entirety.

Not with in any way a malicious or destructive intent, just a true desire to close a case and get their man so that any strong nudge in a direction focuses them solely on that and they become lost along the way. It is second a look at how law enforcement can discover their error in judgement, make an honest attempt to correct it yet still get the answer wrong which results (spoiler coming next) in 2 men being successfully framed, convicted and sentenced for a crime they did not commit. The story was well written with few errors that I discovered, but I did subtract 1 star because I had figured out a major part of the ending long before the book closed (one half of who the true criminals were) and because that ending to me felt very abrupt, kind of like here it comes- WHAM!

I liked that a relatively simple story has qualities of myth even though it deals with fishermen and peasants. The story spans about 80 years of  the 20th century, a time of huge changes but it is not about those changes but about a family living through those changes. Johan and his brother move from a feudal society across a war ravaged Europe, pausing in France post-war and fleeing on to the northwest coast of Scotland, where he befriends a fatherless boy.

An avid reader she has fleshed out her background for her career in the arts with an interest in philosophy, literature, history and physics - a fine matrix for her chosen subject for her debut novel - a fantasy romance that involves other planets and other peoples. She has taught English as a second language, tutored the elderly, instructed elementary students in becoming more fluent readers, worked with wounded veterans and now lives in Maryland with the beautiful nature preserve Assateague Island in sight.  Her decision to publish ENTANGLING DESTINIES was a result of her encounter with cancer. First and foremost Ellen's book is a love story: the fantasy aspect of the two-planet status enhances the intensity of the love about which she writes so well. This fact we know form her opening lines: `Once upon a small planet in a parallel dimension from Earth there lived a young woman who fell in love with an Earth man, whose thoughts she was tasked to monitor to further a Repopulation Program. Taken by his passionate poetic imagery while he was dreaming, she hoped that she could convince him of teletransportation to her planet.  Planet Hespera knew mostly moderate seasons, except for one planned hot spell of short duration, when double suns drove most Hesperans to hibernate indoors. Yet few missed anything that was going on outdoors, and those alert ones grew amazed, when they spotted the Seeress Jula Dar Shen loping through Ballilu's streets. Only her footfalls echoed in the burnished stillness of the seaside town's shimmering squares and alleys. How could she bear that hellish heat was the collective thought. In fact she was blissfully unaware of temperatures, since she dwelt in the mind of her beloved, Leonardo Lacci, who was fishing on planet Earth this moment. Galaxies divide us now, but like two quantum particles as yet apart--we're destined for entanglement!' At moments the struggle with the names and words slow the progress of reading, but that is an accepted risk with fantasy novels. To aid in the out line, the following helps: The inhabitants of Hespera have managed to do the impossible: learn to live with each other in peace. Unfortunately, their Millitusian enemies have threatened to destroy that peace with their forced sterilization of most citizens. In a desperate attempt to save themselves, the Hesperans have launched a \"repopulation program\" through which Earth subjects are sent to Hespera to impregnate them. Having fallen in love with the engaged earthling Leonardo, Hesperan seeress Jula brings him to her planet to seduce him. But once there, Leonardo is repulsed by the eco dome constructed for the program volunteers--for, despite the abundant food and generous accommodations provided, the subjects are not actually allowed to leave the dome...or keep their offspring. Despite Leonardo's attraction to Jula, he never wavers in his desire to return to his home planet. But when his wish is finally granted, Leonardo finds himself unable to stop thinking of his Hesperan lover. As he embarks on a glamorous new life with his fianc&eacute;e, Leonardo begins to suspect that he may have made a huge mistake. The poetic aspect of Ellen Sullivan often takes the forefront of her writing - not a problem as long as the prose reader accepts the diversions. Providing a glossary of terms and names as a quick reference for the reader may be something she will wish to add. But this is a languid romance and one that begs to be read slowly.

A single mother trying to make a better living for her and her son, she has become an overnight sensation in the makeup world by posting videos of her applying makeup on You Tube and launching her own cosmetics line.  Luke's book is informative as well as fun.  I was expecting it to be another step by boring step makeup book and was pleasantly surprised to find that the format could have been put together by a group of girlfriends having an evening out.  She uses different colors and fonts in small descriptive blurbs to share her tips which are practical and everyday user friendly and I found myself feeling like I was reading her journal.  This book will be a joy to any age group reading her advice.  The majority of the book shows Lauren recreating celebrity looks on herself which is what makes this book so good for any person using it.  While she is cute and personable, she isn't an exotic goddess.  Yet, when she recreates herself in a calmer manner of Lady Gaga, her entire face comes to life.  She gives exact details on what cosmetic products to use to make the application goof proof.  Lauren Luke makes applying makeup a pleasurable experience and I am sure that she and her son will be living a better life for a long time.

Its strange to think of a vampire as a good guy, but the glimpse into his life makes him irresistibleand not in the clich, Ive got you under my spell way. The protagonist, Raven, suffers guilt, fear, and loneliness. He asks himself heart-wrenching question that boil down to, How could God love me after what Ive done? I embraced the message that no one is past Gods love. The story was well researched, had good pacing, and included several plot twists, one of which TOTALLY caught me off guard. I wish the book had been longer to flesh out the characters further. But the book won a Cascade Award for Best Speculative Fiction, so it might just be me. Spoiler alert: I became so infuriated with Calandra at one point that I put the book down and emailed this to the author in the middle of the night: I'm reading Blood for Blood, and Calandra just threw Raven to the dogs.

I was expecting a story filled with violence and gore, due to the title.  And since I'm not familiar with the Polish culture, I was not aware of what Duck Blood soup was in the first place. This book is the story of a young medical resident who gets himself hooked on prescription drugs. Rocky Van Slyke is a young man who is on his way to becoming a doctor, but takes a detour courtesy of a shady lawyer, Vincent Buddy, who uses Rocky to get prescriptions filled for his own use. Rocky doesn't see Vince as anything more than a potential friend and the hospital's resident lawyer. Vince uses Rocky by enticing him with the drugs, and demonstrating that these drugs are an easy way of getting high. Being a doctor, it is easy for Rocky to get these drugs by writing up a prescription under false pretenses.  Vince knows that once Rocky is hooked, he'll do anything to help Vince obtain the drugs. The story opens with Rocky finding himself in a hospital and being told he just had a seizure.  They hint to him that it is possibly the exposure to drugs. Thus our story begins.  Rocky is the narrator of DUCK BLOOD SOUP. He goes back and forth in time, alternating the past with the present. He tells the story of his childhood: His father who was always away in the Army; his lonely mother who resorts to finding comfort in the arms of other men; and his life after his mother dies, in which he takes care of his dying crippled father. The story always returns to the present, with Rocky dealing with Vince and his drug habit, his fellow residents at the hospital, and his girlfriend Karla. While at first the reader may not see where the story is headed, it becomes clear that Rocky's past has a lot to do with his present.  Molea does a good job at creating this person, Rocky, and describing what makes him tick.  It also becomes apparent what Vince the shady lawyer is doing to Rocky, and a few secrets come out at the end of the story about this lawyer, which will tie it all together.  Vince's relationship with Rocky, at least to this reviewer, first appears to be innocent, but as the book progresses, it becomes obvious that their relationship is more akin to a parasite. I am recommending DUCK BLOOD SOUP.  It's well written all around, and I hope that Molea continues to write, as he shows he's got what it takes to write a good book.

The art direction is fun and exuberant while being useful.

There are connections to his own past: he once worked for the very men organizing and leading this attack and he knows that they care about nothing other than their pocketbooks. The lethal nerve drug sarin is the weapon du jour and some place in New York City is the target. The action is fast and furious. It spans two continents as the dedicated team of ICE agents races against time to stop a catastrophe of unimaginable portions. They do, at the last minute. If all this sounds a bit over the top, thats because it is. Threat isn't a bad thriller but everything in it happens a little too coincidentally and fast.

What can I say about S.E. Rise.. This is a graphic, horrific, intense, freaky, horror story and I loved it. The monsters are so grotesque and wickedly horrifying, I found myself thinking that Stephen King should read this man's work! The macabre creatures are described so vividly that a couple of times I felt the need to wash the gore and guts off me, this will stay with me for a long time. It was very well written and flowed with a very fast pace, I love the story behind the monsters, the HOW they came to be in existence. Very cool! The two main characters, Robert Walton -an investigative reporter and Jacob Clauson- the man who killed Robert's family, are brought together for an interview and that is when things get very interesting. I would have loved to see Robert get home to Jenny! If you love a macabre, sick, twisted, horrific tale , then this is for you!

LOL. That said, Ill be brutally honest. This book feels as if it was translated from another language into English by someone who speaks the other language primarily, not English. Pronouns are wild and free and often the protagonist is referred to by his name, other times as the boy and many other things. It can make for tough reading, as other characters are also treated to the same casual description... For instance, John Wronski is Traveler (or Grouch, I forget who was who - I think Ralph was Grouch) and the author uses the names interchangeably. It doesnt make the book unreadable, but it does feel like a book without an editor, or a book that was translated very loosely. Also, calling one of the characters, Friend is very difficult when reading aloud to children. It isn't that there is anything wrong with the name, it just gets confusing. I found myself frequently editing on the fly while reading to my children, aged 8 and 10. The book feels very amateurish and I almost didn't bother to get into it. Im glad that I did. I work in the broadcast industry and one thing that Ive learned over the years is that content is king. You can spend a lot of time trying to get that last 1% of perfection out of a piece, and put a lot of time and effort into that polishing, and most people won't notice or care. And if the piece isn't good to begin with, all that polish won't save it anyway. On the other hand, you can take a great story and tell it in a rough, coarse manner - and it will still be a great story. People are not nearly as judgemental of a storys polish as they are of the story itself. If the story is good, the polish doesnt matter. This is one of those stories - at least so far, we haven't finished it yet - I will come back and update when I do. This story has captivate my children (and me too, if were being honest) with its constant surprises and fantastic feeling of adventure. If you can make it past chapter one (suggestion to the author: Read some old Dick Francis horse racing/whodunnit books to see how to drop the reader right in to the middle of the story!) then the story is fast paced and full of non-stop excitement and wonder. Magic and intrigue, and a feeling that anything can happen are big factors in this story. My advice to anyone looking for a great book to read to pre-teen to teen kids is that this book is worth the slight effort to make sense of and the author may have a few rough edges, but she knows how to spin a tale and keep you on the edge of your seat. So far, it is raw and simple, but exciting and full of fun characters that make you want to turn the pages faster and faster so you can find out what happens next. As long as the story delivers a finale worthy of the build-up, this is five stars for me. Ill come back and update when we finish, but I wanted to get a review in so that people could start hearing more about this story right away - Ive been looking for a story like this and they are hard to find for kids these days, so Im kind of excited to share the knowledge with people.</td><td>Overlook the flaws for the most imaginative book in a great while!</td><td>2017-10-12</td><td>611</td><td>2017</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>67000241</td><td>2</td><td>true</td><td>2016-10-04</td><td>A2CCG5FEUT19MH</td><td>B01G0R4LE2</td><td>Salena T.</td><td>These were very flimsy and thin.

Inspector Lestrade calls in two detectives, Sherlock Holmes and Jason Dark, to investigate the murder of John Balderston. But, the murder is not as elementary as Holmes might believe. This time Dark battles with a foe (or is that two?) from his past. I liked the introduction of Holmes into the story, but I would liked to have seen more of him. I really expected (hoped for) a twist at the end with Holmes included. Lestrade was given a good part of the story and I enjoyed every minute of it. While the villains are from earlier stories, I had no trouble keeping up with this novella. This is the tenth novella of the series, but all of the stories, that I have read, stand alone.

Soon her hosts, Rick and Stewy, turn up deadmurderedand the last two people who saw them alive disappear. Well, except for Louisa that is, who now appears a suspect to the Fijian police, especially DI Vika who never liked her in the first place. But the Fijian police are missing all the clues, which means that Louisa will have to step in to help. The only problem is, her jurisdiction is limited to Tarawa, and DI Vika doesnt want her doing anything other than sitting in her hotel room guarded over by the annoyingly untidy and too talkative Constable Makereta. Lucky for Louisa that Makereta likes and trusts her, even though she also thinks Louisa should stop swearing and go to church once in a while. Together will Makereta and Louisa be able to outwit the Fijian drug lords and street gangs in order to find the murderer? I very much enjoyed this novel.

The plot seems unreasonable and unlikely to really happen; but the way in which John tells the story makes it definitely believable.

That too is brought to a devastating halt when the same gang attacks him and one of them crushes his knee with a pipe. Carter is so incensed, he strangles  one of the gang members. The police say it is self defense. Now, Carter is so twisted up in his mind, he believes himself to be a monster, a man that can never be trusted because of his seemingly murderous rages.

She's sure she saw something in Auger's Well and she's determined to find out the truth. In order to get the whole story, she'll need to follow Leon Gauvreau and his young son half way around the world to rural Quebec, and what she finds might change all of their lives. Unforgivable is part romance, part mystery, part paranormal suspense novel.  The characters are well developed: Piper the quintessential journalist, driven to understand what makes the world tick, determined to answer the who, what, where and when like a good investigator, even when the world she finds can't be hammered into the reality she's sure must exist and people like Leon Gauvreau won't play the role of villain he's been cast in by the others who've provided their reports of the events at the Marie Celeste. Leon, for his part, struggles trying to fit himself into way too many roles, villain, father, protector and eventually lover  and overlaying it all is his perception of himself as a cursed man  both victim and villain and he will do anything to keep the effects of that curse from impacting his son Henri. Often the most compelling of the characters is young Henri, the bright, inquisitive, innocent but often very perceptive young boy who fate is his father's obsession and who quickly captures Piper's heart. The story is filled out with a strong supporting cast of characters, most of them broken, in some way, by the fallout from the incident in Augers Well and, the Australian Outback and the sweeping vistas of rural, eastern Quebec  wild and beautiful in the early summer. Unforgivable is a great read, either as the next installment of the Incorruptables series or as a stand alone read.  Spice up your summer with a mystery you'll love.

After reading the synopsis, I really wasn't sure I would like it. While I like some paranormal, it is not typically my first choice. However, since this book was free on kindle unlimited, I figured why not try it. I found myself hooked in quite quickly. It was nothing like I expected and not even remotely similar to anything I've ever read.  The book was written from Kane's first person perspective. Typically, first person from a male point of view throws me off a bit, but this one didn't. I loved being inside his head. The characters in this story were so well developed. I easily became attached to most all of them. I will be so disappointed if this doesn't turn into a series so I can catch up on how things turn out for each one. Kane was a bad man who ultimately became the only good in so many lives. Alannah was his perfect foil. She was hard enough to handle being in Kane's life but also softened his rough edges in his relationships with others. So much crazy stuff happens in this story, but I really think it would spoil it to have too many details before experiencing it. I will just say that it is a total and complete emotional roller coaster in the most amazing way.  If you have read the Blackness series and liked it, you will also love this.

The author takes the fear and uncertainty out of the process. Her roadmap for creating books is simple but effective. Granted, the book that she completes (and publishes!) in 8 hours isn't Nabokov's Pale Fire or anything close, but that's to be expected. Yet her system is flexible, whether you're doing it all in one day, as did she, or stretching it out over a few days or weeks. All the details are here in an easy-to-read book that has a pleasant, conversational tone. One of the most enjoyable parts of the book is the beginning, where the author shares with us details about the many distractions that came her way as she tried to get started on writing this book. She still completed the book, obviously, and certainly within the 8-hour time limit. Veteran authors might find this book to be too basic, especially if they're overly set in their ways. Regardless, if you'd like to see how another author writes, and writes fast, this little book will show you.

I LOVED this book. So, hear me out: What I liked about this book: Just about everything. The idea was a really nice one, a breath of fresh air through all the paranormal stuff out there now. Tryst, the hero was enjoyable to fallow around in his innocence, cruelty and low-morals. Even if he constantly lost his head and did bad things, I never got judgmental. I just thought it fit her personality, which means... um, yeah, he's a well-done character. The other characters were also interesting and I never felt bogged down even if there were a lot of them. Never had a 'who the heck is that' moment. Which, again... well done :) The setting - Oooh, the setting. I think it's this more than anything else that made me love this book. I haven't read something set in the early 1900s since... well, since East of Eden, I think. Loved it! I was getting kinda sick of modern-day paranormal, and this filled my batteries nicely. The style - though there was a lot of narration in here, it wasn't boring. At all. I enjoyed the way Trystan told the story, his voice and the length of everything - from chapters to scenes (even if the chapters were loooong, I had nothing against it ;)) Okay, let's get to the dirty stuff: Why this book didn't get 5 full stars. There are 3 main reasons: 1. The story's ending. It just kinda drifted off with no climax and no conclusion. I understand this is the first in a series. I would read the next book. But I felt like this one should get some sort of resolve too. -> This is the main main reason the book didn't get 5 stars (for me) 2. I really didn't get it whether the were population and vampires and such were in hiding from the humans. I mean, I understood that it was preferable that the humans didn't know someone was were, but were they aware that such creatures were out there and just didn't want to meet them? Or were supernatural creatures like a different, not very accepted, race? 3. I'm an a-hole and don't really give 5 stars all that often or easy. -> this is a pretty important reason, too. Would I recommend this book - yes, I enjoyed it and I think many other people will as well. Would I read the sequel - um, yes. Would I read this book again... Um, maybe.

I don't know how Ms. Martin does it but I fall completely enamored with her couples and Logan and Roman were it for me in Reckless Surrender. We are treated again with alternate point of views from each of our main characters.  I didn't realize how much I enjoy reading into each of their minds.  The depth of each of their pasts and the challenges they face is so real.  We are once again reminded what an important role God plays in their lives and how they bring each other peace.

This was simply outstanding if you love historical romance with a swashbuckling story line, strong heroine and equally strong hero, who, though Alpha enough to satisfy the most starry-eyed teen, was also sensitive, understanding, self-sacrificing and altogether swoon-worthy. Despite a few anachronisms of language, the historical detail of this book is right on point. Who wants to read Chaucererian language anyway? I was so fascinated by the interplay between France, England and the duchy of Brittany that I actually reviewed the history to refresh my memory, only to find that Ms. Belle had done her research well. A history buff myself, I appreciated that this book made the political climate of the times so accessible to the modern reader. The fictional characters were skillfully woven into factual incidents of the beginning of the Hundred Years War. Details of clothing, weaponry, shipbuilding and more added to the sense of being right in the story. Far from being a cliffhanger, Love of a Lioness has a wonderful HEA ending as well. In fact, I almost wished there had been a bit of a hint that we'd see these characters or some of the side characters again. Well, one can hope. That war did go on for quite a long time, after all. If this is your kind of book, you'll want to read this one.</td><td>Simply outstanding</td><td>2014-12-13</td><td>240</td><td>2014</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>67000307</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2015-10-24</td><td>A132TSYRPLS60S</td><td>912944099</td><td>R3 Woodworker</td><td>A very good reference, priced right, and arrived quickly.

This SMYLLS Hand Drip Coffee Maker is good one to make a couple of coffee at the same time. The cone is quite small and compact. You have to be careful not to overflow when you make for 3 cups. Actually I wouldn't recommend if you are looking for a pour over dripper just for single serve. It's better and no hassle with the ones without carafe. The glass carafe is beautiful and cute design in its whole figure. The con is that it gets very hot to hold around the rubber band and you'd need an oven mitten. I thought the rubber part was where you can grab to pour coffee though. Also the package came nicely wrapped and in a nice box but kind of bizarre. The pictures of the coffee makers on the box are not the one you actually get. And the instruction written on it is not clear with weird English which made me skeptic of the product quality before I opened it. (refer to the photos) There was no care instruction either.

We stayed with friends for two weeks in Georgetown, SC and then for over a month with our son in Jacksonville, FL. I bought non-resident licenses in both states and went to nearby piers and bridges. I was surprised to find that it was not as cut and dried a task as this Upstate NY trout fisherman thought. I promised myself to do some studying of the subject before this years' trip south. With that in mind I began to search the internet for comprehensive guides on the subject of pier and bridge fishing. I came across this book while looking through Amazon's lengthy lists of offerings. A quick look inside was enough for me to see that \"The Honest Guide\" provided just the sort of material I needed to educate myself. Brian Perry has brought a lifetime of experience to the pages of his book. He discusses etiquette to use on piers. Oh yes my friends, there is a right way and a wrong way to deal with your fellow fisherfolk out there. He describes different types of tackle to use as well as the best baits and how to use them. One of the hardest things for me to figure out was the weird looking terminal tackle used and the knots to rig it. Brian made me feel much more comfortable about all of this. There are chapters about where and when to go for particular fish and where to find them when you get there. He describes the differences in the types of fish that you will pull out. I was amazed to catch at least five or six different kinds my first time out including three types of sharks. Although my primary interest was pier and bridge fishing, Brian has included chapters related to inland and coastal waters as well. I intend to keep this book in my backpack when I am out fishing so that I can refer to it often. I highly recommend this book to beginners in the sport of saltwater fishing as well as seasoned pros.</td><td>Excellent book for newbie saltwater fisherfolk.</td><td>2014-01-30</td><td>353</td><td>2014</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>67000317</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>2017-01-10</td><td>A3GTBV5FU3Q3YI</td><td>897323831</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Nice hiking guide for portland</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>2017-01-10</td><td>5</td><td>2017</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>67000318</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2017-12-19</td><td>A35VKOUPUW08QW</td><td>B01CS93S2W</td><td>JoJo</td><td>I LOVE this Christmas tree!

SPOILERS BELOW (though I tried to not reference anything too directly): I see the book as being split into two completely different parts by the author - both with different themes and messages.  The first - the majority of the book - is a rip snorting old fashioned adventure space-opera with unique characters and wonderful spectacle.  I thoroughly enjoyed this part.  It was so imaginative and well thought out.  Yes, I recognized the obstinance and evil and dark capitalism demonstrated by the human societies as depicted by the author,  but I also thrilled at the individual human spirit, excitement of the low gravity races and saves, and the overall opulence that was portrayed in parallel.  I felt this part of the book could have been doubled in size and would have been truly epic.  Kudos on this portion of the book. The second part of the book - the end that seemed to be have been suddenly slapped onto the first part of the book (and just when the story was getting good too) - was abrupt and disheartening and a sad commentary on human kind that belatedly twists into a courageous jump into the universe. The two parts wildly do not seem to go together even though both messages (adventure and defeat) do resonate with me.  I really felt the sudden ending did a huge disservice to the book.  The resulting fates of the main characters were so terrifying and yet strangely apathetic that I was totally stunned and dismayed.  It was as if all power was taken from these powerful larger than life characters and their fates were resolved with a whimper instead of a bang.  I think this resolution coupled with the incongruous combining of these two differently themed parts into one book ruined the book for me.  Talk about a splash of frigid water to the face!  Apparently the author was using this abrupt resolution of the story as a means to express his personal commentary and opinion (an obviously negative one) of mankind's nature (and maybe even a swipe at current times).  The epic space opera suddenly turns into a hard hitting sermon and cautionary tale.  But in doing this, the author ends up doing his fantastic characters and the original story a huge injustice,  And the reader is left with a message that no matter how hard or fantastically one strives, everything can be forcibly and suddenly removed from you in the end.  A total downer for such an epic story.  I emotionally rejected that feeling and ultimately (unfortunately)this book. I will continue to watch for future books from this author.  He is supremely talented.  Hopefully I will enjoy the conclusion of the next book better (or at least not be so let down by it).</td><td>Excellent book with fantastic characters and a breath taking setting.

The ERP provides a wealth of information and data about the nation's economic activity. This type of information is perhaps no more critical than in times of economic downturn. Want to know more about employment trends? Housing construction? Trends in investment? Perspectives on the stimulus and what it actually did? It's all in here. Don't trust it? Well, fact-check it against analyses from the CBO or GAO, or other impartial sources - but don't just discard it. But, of course, the ERP is more than just pure economic information. It's also a political document, and often contains the clearest statement of priorities for whichever administration is issuing it outside the State of the Union - and this is important too, regardless of whether or not you agree with the White House's current occupant. Oppose Obama? Read this, grapple with it, and better define for yourself which parts of Obama's agenda you really don't like - or which parts can serve as common ground. Support Obama? Read this and make sure you know what it is you like about his policy preferences - and which parts of his agenda might not jive with your expectations. I realize it's a long report, and I also realize a lot of this stuff might be difficult reading. I'd just encourage folks to do their best with it. One of the advantages of living in a liberal market democracy is the availability of information; I think it's important not to under-appreciate this fact. And if you don't make use of the information available to you as a citizen to make informed choices about who to support, you're just not doing your job.</td><td>Required Reading</td><td>2010-02-12</td><td>297</td><td>2010</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>67000325</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2016-06-18</td><td>A1OWLZZAU5LGUT</td><td>B01EO64QUA</td><td>Ginny Y.</td><td>This well-built storage box should last for a very long time.

A short, complex and innovative novel, it has an almost perfect balance between character-driven plot and straight analytical mental games that challenge you to unravel the puzzle before the author gives it away. Fans of the murder mystery genre will have a hard time not enjoying \"The Tokyo Zodiac Murders\". The story starts off with a powerful hook.  In 1936, an old eccentric artist named Heikichi Umezawa has been found dead, leaving behind a last will and confession detailing his obsession with alchemy and astrology, and his plan to construct a perfect woman, named Azoth.  His plans are incredibly detailed, but basically involve taking body parts from several astrologically perfect women, then assembling those pieces together in sequence. He is dead before he can put his plans into place, but someone else finishes the deed.  The murders are never solved, and remain one of Japan's most studied cases, with amature detectives pouring over the details in the same way as they do with Jack the Ripper nowadays.  Fast forward to 1979, where Kazumi Ishioka, a freelance illustrator and fan of mysteries, gleans some new insight into the case and decides to pursue it.  He enlists his friend, astrologer Kiyoshi Mitarai, and the two begin their dark journey into the mind of the Zodiac murderer, going down roads that seem obvious once the links are made, but appear impossible beforehand. Author Soji Shimada knows how to construct a good murder mystery.  He takes the classic Holmes/Watson team, a fact which he quickly acknowledges in the text of the book, and uses them to hunt an intricate puzzle, based on his own in-depth knowledge as an astrologer. Many mystery staples are here.  A locked-door murder.  A prime suspect dead before the murders occurred. He takes the basic elements and cliches, gives the reader a nod to let them know that he knows what he is doing, then shuffles them all around until you are completely baffled and utterly enthralled.  Especially impressive is his use of multiple writing styles, such as flipping between Heikichi Umezawa insane confession and Ishioka and Mitarai's lighthearted banter.  He also makes judicious use of charts and illustrations, even occasionally breaking the fourth wall and personally challenging the reader to solve the mystery before he reveals all in the next chapter. The only shame with \"The Tokyo Zodiac Murders\" is that it is the only one of Shimada's many \"Detective Mitarai Mystery\" novels to be translated into English.  As soon as you flip the last page, you are going to be hungry for more of the same.

SPOILERS GALORE follows. This book has promise. The concept, if it were pared down to a less complex scenario, would carry far better than the chaotic mess you start with. Before I go on, though, here are some quick things that could be done to make the book better (for me, let me emphasize that this is my opinion). 1. Nomad is impressive as a world killer without the pages and pages of expositions, explanations and actions that the Earth takes to divert it/destroy it. By the end of Part I, I kind of hoped it would destroy the whole solar system - like wanting the psycho killer to win in the bad horror movie. Details: one nuclear strike is enough instead of multiple, one attempt to divert/deflect it, leaving the last attempt by Wolf as the final failure instead of going on and on until I felt like screaming at the text to get on with it. Yes, I could have just skipped it, but I agreed to read the whole book not skip to the good parts. 2. Earth's descent into chaos and destruction. This is a Kitchen sink scenario pepper with every cut scene from every disaster movie I have ever seen. Again, one terrorist attack would have been sufficient, a mad scramble for resources, the attempt of one underground ark (2012) to save humanity. Instead, the book goes on and on dragging in every terrorist group from Al Qaeda to ISIL in an act of overkill that makes me feel like someone decided to combine the Titanic movie (Cameron) with 2012 and Event Horizon. 3. We spend entirely too much time with the oncoming destruction of the Earth before stopping in our tracks and saying, sorry, this story is about another story set 50k in the future and all the stuff before was someone else's story. The book could have done the same in a few concise pages and summaries of the disaster instead of way too much detail. The scientific evidence and explanations hovered somewhere between information overload and a silly sense I was in a Dr. Strangelove Parody where the director is trying to trick me into skipping all this in order to pull a fast one over on me. By the time Part I is over, I feel like I have lived through every disaster movie made from When worlds collide to Independence Day Resurgence. I would have skipped it for something simple, symbolic, emotional, an abbreviated version of Armageddon (movie) without the happy ending. The book suffers from way too much science. The story gets repeatedly lost while the Astronauts, or Houston or the fascinating Dr. Mason or her AI goes into so much detail that even an amateur science nut like myself decides not to google any of it if there's a chance we can get on with it. It boggles my mind that the main character, Wolf, is not scientifically literate enough to handle this in the beginning of the book yet becomes more literate by the end as a means of \"character growth?\" I ask because it's the only plausible explanation I can come up with. Wolf suffers from lengthy explanations of what makes him different. It damages his character in the long run. It like character development in a movie, we want to SEE why Wolf is a good man, not have it told to us in long flashbacks/dialogues/or third person omniscient narratives. The irony is that we do get to see it anyway through the course of the story, but by the time we see Wolf in action I feel like I have been flogged to death with all the reasons he is that way instead of just being shown it through action in the plot. One of the hardest things to do when writing a book is to decide on POV. How is the story told? The temptation of almost every writer is third person omniscient. It is a cheat in order to allow the narrator and the reader to know the thoughts of every character and their base motivations. It also destroys most good books completely. I really feel like this book would have been so much better if the whole story had been told only from Wolf's POV or at most Wolf and Nala's POV. Synthia is fascinating but too omniscient to make me comfortable. The story would have flowed better if we were to filter all the events through Wolf's perspective only from beginning to end. What he knew we would know, leaving him ignorant of the final fate of the Earth would carry him on a quest to learn that fate even as he starts to explore the new world and its denizens. Capitalizing and exploring why he is an Astronaut \"savant\" instead of a scientifically minded one would be more interesting that having to go through dialogues where he is told/we are told all that is necessary to be told. Instead, we should be forced to solve each mystery of why Dr. Mason's odd behaviors and motivations, her obsessive reactions where Wolf is concerned. It's the author having faith that we will diligently pursue the plot because we identify with an ignorant or misinformed hero as he desperately searches to find out what happened and why it is important to him. Next, Dialogue. Admittedly dialogue is very hard to reproduce since if you strive for real dialogue you have to acknowledge that most of us spend more time talking about mundane stuff that is both boring and does not advance any plot but still conveys our emotional states. Movies murder dialogue more than others all the time (if the actors are particularly good then it's less noticeable). Collateral (Tom Cruise/Jamie Foxx) is a good example of this conflict. The struggle in dialogue is to make characters talk like real people but reveal enough of their inner turmoil and desires to drive the story. Notice, I say story, not plot. We, as readers, care about the story, it's why we are reading this book (usually). The plot is a framework that surrounds and directs the story. We want to understand why Hakkon goes nuts and destroys everything that is good in his life, we don't want to dredge through customs and even more expositional explanations to find out the whys of it all. Having said that, the dialogue in this book is forced at best, and at worst, it has too much exposition in the regular narrative. What follows are suggestions about the dialogue rather than criticism. As you will see (if you are really reading this) I want to like this book. The potential here is enormous. 1. It would be better for me that Wolf and Syn are not honest with each other about their feelings for each other. Syn is holding back the reasons for her actions because she feels that Wolf will not, cannot, understand, what drives her to do so because she doesn't understand the programming that Dr. Mason has input into her code. This could lead to a mystery where Wolf and Syn have to travel to the Moon base in order to learn why Syn act in seemingly erratic, random ways at certain times. Wolf can be much the same as he realizes that he is falling in love with a hologram but cannot force himself to the idea that in all essence, he is in love with a mirage of a woman, dead for the last 50k years. Through the course of the story and many dialogues, their feelings could come together as they both realize that they feel pretty much feel the same way about one another. Resolving to explore a means of being together by learning why all this attraction is happening. You can still have the flirting, the close encounters, but instead of blatant attraction; you convey desire, passion and more human emotions accompanied by the need to recklessly abandon all logic in the pull that makes all of us human. 2. Second, Wolf's dialogue with the new humans is unbelievable. I get that Wolf is a talented linguist but jeepers, there's no language barrier to struggle with. He just automatically picks it all up and misses the opportunity to experience the nuances and new meanings to old words. Instead, the transition is so quick that I felt robbed of a great part of the book as Wolf learns to communicate with the locals. He could have missed the signs that Nala is not who she presents herself to be.  Hakkon is really the villain that he turns out to be, and that Onel is more heroic than he pretends. That Silvaine and Johan have more character than just flat villains who delight in being evil. That Waylan is more than the other new humans, that he is lonely, that he, not only needs Wolf, but he also needs a new mate. So many things/plot twists are missed in just a simple chance that is just there waiting to be used. The dialogue was a huge problem for me. I was constantly stopping to say \"who talks like this?\" My answer is no one unless you are in a bad James Bond film or comic book from the 60's. I could go on but I feel like I am close to nitpicking. I am going to bring up 3 epic heroes and what sets them apart from Wolf. AND why Wolf could be all three of them. 1 Gilgamesh is the first superhero of literature (for me). He is invulnerable, super strong, practically immortal (demigod) and wise. But he is also foolish, egotistical, and almost two-dimensional, in many ways, as a character. That is until he meets and befriends Enkidu. Through his relationship with Enkidu we see Gilgamesh stop being super and become heroic even as he loses the only other person he really cares about. His struggle to rescue his friend from death and his eventual acceptance that he is not as god-like as he thinks he is; it makes him understand what it is to be human in accepting the consequences of life and death. All this makes Gilgamesh a great hero, it even makes his story worth reading and rereading. 2. Achilles. The consummate ideal of the warrior, nearly invulnerable, who like his predecessor is vain and proud but falls for a mortal man who he takes to be his best friend. He loses his friend because of his own ego, he loses his life because he cannot get over that loss (there are other reasons but I see them as minor to this central one). It is not so much that Achilles is betrayed and slain by an arrow to his ankle as he betrays himself to death. He goes through a distinct change transforming into an even greater hero by becoming mortal (for all intents and purposes). I really like what Brad Pitt did with the role in Troy. The idea of Achilles is growth, the hero stops being perfect only to realize he is far from it. 3. Sigfried (or Sigurd) and there are many stories about him, but as it pertains to Wolf, I will keep this short. Sigurd is also almost invulnerable, he is armed with nearly invincible weaponry and even rescues/courts a Valkyrie (shieldmaiden) to his side, yet he fails her in the end. I see the parallels here. This could well be Wolf and Syn. My point is that while Wolf does prove to be vulnerable it is less a character flaw than an unfortunate side effect that is almost immediately remedied (0r at least it seems to be). Wolf should take elements from each of these heroes, throw in a little of the Native American Spirit, Coyote and top it with the Bushido Code of searching for perfection and instead of a superman with some kryptonite, you find a tragic hero who must struggle as we all struggle to overcome the obstacles in the story. Finally, I have major issues with the prophecy. It's okay to have it, but it's only brought up when we have a clear idea of the role Wolf has in it. I mean there is no discrepancy- none- it's Wolf without a doubt. I would rather find out that everyone thought Waylan was supposed to be it, or Johan started out as the hero of prophecy before he was turned to evil. That Wolf falls into being the prophesized hero more than just shows up and some kid goes \"hey, you are the hero of prophecy\" and Wolf goes \"no, I am not,\" but he really doesn't resist it. And I go, \"of course!\" In conclusion. Okay, maybe not. One more thing keeps bugging me. It's the or rather all the Deus Ex Machinas that are thrown out here. It's back to overkill. The shuttle on its own is an overpowered device but as the story continues it gets bigger and bigger with way too many rooms to fit in any shuttle and comes out feeling more like the Defiant from DS9 that a NASA variant. It also goes from a Scientific vessel to a Star Destroyer...and, I have to ask why in the hell would you build a star destroyer when there are no aliens in this book? Nomad is a big hunk of ice/rock. Nuclear missiles don't scratch it so why would you hand a star destroyer to the guy who is going out to study it? Nope, I got no answers. Then there's the laser gun and mack-mini. I don't see us having either in 10 years. They're are way too convenient, plus that are plenty of conventional firearms that would be more likely.  What the hell is an astronaut doing with such ordinance when there is no threat unless you need laser guns to counter the terrorist threat (pick one of them, the books got them all -well not the IRA but almost all of them). Okay, I am done. In closing, I would rewrite this book as something simpler. There is much potential here but mainly it suffers from mass overkill and too many details that the story, which I am pretty sure it has, gets lost in all the chaos.</td><td>There is a good book in here somewhere.</td><td>2017-01-02</td><td>2413</td><td>2017</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>67000341</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2017-12-05</td><td>AVGX1LJRFCZQE</td><td>1944937250</td><td>Don</td><td>Great book cant wait for the next one</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>2017-12-05</td><td>8</td><td>2017</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>67000342</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2015-11-09</td><td>A2Y6F4ODXXF4GI</td><td>B01AHFK08Y</td><td>Ralph</td><td>I've talked several friends into buying  the Black and Decker kitchen scrubber.

Book 2 was just as thrilling as book 1, and both books are very different to other stories in this genre. Having said that however, it did get a little more complicated here with the He.'s (view spoiler), than in book 1; more fragments to follow, making it harder to get my head around. However no matter how many parts to Gillian, she was still great! Very vulnerable and strong, almost in equal measure, she deserves a break thats for sure. Simon, Miles give her a break, LOL... Simon and Miles; both evil but one with more redeeming qualities than the other, and one with few boundaries when it comes to physically harming the one he purports to love. Simon is definitely a super-hot H., and Miles is just as hot but the Anti H. here. Its great to get two for one, as it were. There was more of Miles here but mostly a physical presence. I would have loved to have read more of what makes him tick; more about his past relationship with Gillian (and her Mother); what/where he expected their relationship to go as it were; more intimacy between the two would have been great! We know they got married but it is just mentioned almost as an aside; much more could have been done around this event. The writing is much looser this time around, or maybe more comfortable would describe it better; it was 'lighter' somehow, less 'dark' than bk. 1. The author is getting into her stride with part 2, more confident with her characters, and which way the story is headed. Once I started to read it, I could not put it down till Id finished it. I liked the ending; never saw that coming but again a missed opportunity to 'explore' it, in greater detail. Miles and Simon certainly deserved that at least. I don't see a 3rd book here unless it is the exploration to which I refer, and hope the author does not go there; its a good place to leave it IMO. Any more will spoil what are two great reads.

Consensus are the top three positions should be filled by Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. Chronologically, that is correct, but on the measure of greatness the top prize must surely go to Beethoven. Because on the count of not just by the greater popularity of his massively brilliant Concertos, Sonatas and Symphonies with the masses by far but also by the most sorrowful conditions under which Beethoven composed his music. Most laymen uninitiated to Classical music will know Symphony number 5. But his Magnum Opus must be Symphony number 9 which was the chosen piece in Berlin 2014 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Only Symphony 9, written by their beloved German composer, can match the utmost celebratory climax of the pride of the Germans. But his greatness is magnified to infinity when we learn about his immensely tortured life from his progressive deafness. Deafness deprived him of the most important sense and tool for a musician. Yet he strove on under such crushing obstacle to producing music so divine and out of this world. His deafness turned him into a shy misanthrope hence deprived him of the joys of social interactions and the chance to enjoy other musicians' music. Unlike Bach and Mozart, Beethoven had no caring wife to fuss over his comforts and other mundane matters.  But perhaps it was isolation from other musical influence that underpinned the originality of his exquisitely uplifting romantic music. His financial situation left him for want not because he couldn't sell his music, but more because of the evil influences around him diverting his money away and leaving him living from hand to mouth. His penurious condition became more deplorable towards the end of his life when he no longer had the patronage of a rich prince. Yet Beethoven was a Godly man who wanted the best for his ungrateful nephew and to provide for his future at the expense of his own material comfort.  My tears fell when I came to the part when the completely deaf Beethoven finished conducting his newly completed Symphony number 9 to the thunderous applause from the audience. With his back to the audience, Beethoven, oblivious to the applause, was tapped on the shoulder. He turned around to face the applauding audience. The audience was shocked to see his pitiable penurious and sickly state, eliciting great sympathy pouring out for this man. Deaf to the world, this lonely man died after a long painful illness. But yet he lives on, in the hearts and souls of all who love his music until eternity. The joy and happiness are the priceless gifts Beethoven has given mankind.</td><td>His magnificent work precedes the story of Beethoven, a deaf and lonely man who lived to create beautiful music and to provide f</td><td>2015-01-29</td><td>465</td><td>2015</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>67000350</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2016-06-08</td><td>A1I34N9LFOSCX7</td><td>B01DIHACYA</td><td>Smeggy</td><td>This is an awesome long spoon perfect for stirring a big pitcher of iced tea.

I did receive an advanced reading copy from the publisher. And probably won't get another...! My Take Bloody hell! This story has no focus and so many primary subplots going on with the wrong one taking precedence. Actually, I suspect this is meant to be the first in a series, so it would have behooved Besson to focus there. To have all the minor plots revolve back to the main one, the main characters whom I believe are John, Victoire, and Luc (JVL). Instead, its so all over the place thatJVL are NOT getting their due. Instead, they're battling for primacy with Loc and Connie. Its also JVLs new company versus the ice core samples and here is where JVL wins hands down. In spite of the core samples being so incredibly important, Besson ignores them, just as he ignores the plight of the Bouch-Bel-Air. While an uneven play of drama and tension exists, I spent more time rolling my eyes and noting way too many oh, pleases to make this a fun read. Its incredibly confusing, partly because of the lack of focus and too many main players who don't come across as competent. I gotta wonder why John or Victoire are even in the business; Im not impressed with either of them. Sure they're nice enough people, and Besson has set up an interesting background for them, but John spends way too much time being humiliated while Victoire is such a weasely chicken heart that I want them to find new jobs. As for Lucyeah, hes colorful, but more in the sense of a curious child then a competent operative. Besson does have a way with words---with a nod to Julie Roses translation---muffle the howling of Greenland as it begins to die. However, Besson over- or underplays everything. He contradicts his characters, and throws in disconnected sentences that don't appear to be related to what the character is saying with info dumps galore. Could someone explain how Luc is flourishing at Fermatown when they're just doing boring background checks and tedious surveillance? Things don't change. Change your way of seeing them. That is all you need to do. Geez, the evil villain speech at the end was so lame.and consistent to the end as well as it jumped all over the place. Loose threads include Navaran, a minor point I grant, but I do worry about her; why is anyone anxious to buy up Greenland if its falling apart; who Jensen works for; why the Congress is so nasty; Isabelles purpose in this other than for salacious value; the meaning behind the South is heading north; why Luc, in his freelance reporter role, wouldnt find Connies name familiar; why Isabelle spills so much to this reporter; the point of preventing the chopper and its cargo from taking off; the point of the sister ship; Terre-Noires massive incompetence; why John went up to Josephine when the truth is already known; and, why French interest is a problem; and, the significance of Qaalasoq nodding to Moller. Then there are the stupid moves which include handing over the ships plans to the enemy. In what world is this considered a smart decision? Why does Connie wait so long to kill the jerks? WHAT was the point of allowing things to go so far? The box that would cause the police to sink the shipand here Im expecting something earth shattering, something so incredibly horrible*ow, ow, ow, that eye roll hurt!* Why would Laura believe a North Land employee would have information about a Terre-Noire ship? What was the point of keeping Mary out of the loop about the hotel? Why is John reeling from the knowledge that Qaalasoq learned French at an art gallery? Actually, why would someone learn French at an art gallery? How is John planning to pilot two Zodiacs all by himself? What was the point of Luc sleeping with these women? Oh, puh-lease It was now his turn to keep secrets. The two Inuits looked at the Frenchman with respect. Why?? Intellectually, I get that Im supposed to be sad, outraged, and tense, but Besson had me so annoyed and confused that I simply couldn't wait to finish. Its incestuous with all the overlap and excess, and if this is how real world intelligence operatives maneuver through the world, Im not surprised the world is so effed up. Please, Besson, get a developmental editor!! The Story Caught in the tumultuous wave caused by the Lauge Koch Kyst, a part of Greenland, falling into the ocean, the Bouch-Bel-Air faces her fate and prays in the face of a gigantic whirlpool of icy black mud. Her mission? To uncover the secrets of the ages before the earth is destroyed. If she can survive. The Characters The former Major John Spencer Larivire and his wife, Victoire Augagneue, have both retired from French Intelligence to form their own strategic-and criminal-analysis firm, Fermatown. And why they did, Ill never understand as they seem to be clueless in the field. Their former agency, that claims to value them, gives them grunt work and rarely pays them. Each has a horrible past which Besson either over- or underplays. Hey, at least Besson is consistent. Caresse is Victoires cat. Luc Masseron is the third partner in Fermantown; hes bisexual and supposedly a tech geek with unconventional ideas. As part of their intelligence-gathering, they have a left-wing blog, future-probe.com. I really liked this idea. Very fresh and original. John is also Florent de la Salle, the editorial director while Luc Martinent is a freelance reporter for it. Marc Racine is the fake name Luc uses to impersonate a doctor. Alicia Spenser is the artist aunt who died and left John this amazing house. French Intelligence Hubert de Mricourt is the director at Les Invalides. Deputy Director Franois Guerot is in charge of security clearance investigations as well as Johns handler. Thomas Curvien is the driver who picks up Victoire. Sbastien Le Gall is a former colleague of Victoires as well as an experienced analyst and energy expert. Terre-Noire Terre-Noire is a Franco-Danish oil-and-gas company, one of a few of the major companies left. Nicolas Lanier is the executive chairman who is hiding out. Christophe Maunay is the Human Resources manager caught up in scandal; Claudine Desprs answers the phones. Paul Gessar/Gressin is the scientific director for the Arctic and one of Brissacs former students. Gaia is a geological assets software program that knows where all the oil, gas, and minerals are located. How and why would Isabelle know so much about it? Whats the reason for the relationships she has? The Bouc-Bel-Air, a scientific research vessel Loc Le Guvenec is the captain of the ship, a man who lives for the sea and not his over-sexed wife, Isabelle, who seems to be sleeping with everyone but her husband. Rox Oa is the traitorous Spanish boatswain, who comes aboard as a last-minute replacement. Sylvain Velot replaces Hu Yuanyuan. Romain Brissac, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist and renowned climatologist, is Isabelles primary lover. A mission biologist doubles as a doctor. North Land North Land, a Canadian-American company, is Terre-Noires chief competition. Abraham and Geraldine Harper run the company and hire John to bodyguard their daughter, Mary. Shes a right handful, and John doesnt actually do much to guard her. Harold is their never-seen son. Arvid Moller is their scientific director in Greenland. Qaalasoq is a trusted Inuit of the Wild Dog clan. Sakaeunngueq, aka Sak, is a friend of Qaalasoqs and has a couple of sled dog teams. Navaran is his wife. The Northern Peoples Congress A Valkyrie and lawyer for the Congress, Connie Rasmussen is great friends with Laura and strident in defense of the killer polar bears. Laura Al-lee-Ah is a world renowned artist of bears and president of the Congress. Thor Johannsen is director of Arctoil, a Norwegian North Sea oil company. Dr. Patrick has been treating John for his grafts. Aim Toussaint is a lifeguard at the Club Interralli where Gabriel is a bartender. Omar Al Selim is the rich Qatar businessman who bailed Maunay out. Per Sorenson is a Danish assassin while Lars Jensen is another assassin-for-hire, willing to perform the most heinous acts. Hanne Jorth is head of Danish Defense Intelligence Security. The tupliaq is a charm made of dead human and animal parts. The Cover The cover is a collage reflecting important concepts in the story: the Eiffel Tower, of course, represents French interests while the iceberg calving off the cliff face represents Greenland, and the lines for longitude and latitude at the top of a flattened global map represents the North Pole, the source of the waters that will flood the world.

There are three very talented musicians, Kit, Vince and Abby, Vince's adorable and gifted child. I love the main characters but also the minor characters. Altogether, they make for a cozy yet humorous ensemble. I also really enjoyed the love scenes, there was so much depth to these scenes, perhaps because the lovers had been each others' firsts. Playing guitars together on the beach for old times' sake and the final scene were romantic and memorable. I felt like I was there. I also enjoyed the teaching scenes. The author did a great job sharing the worlds of theater, college, music, and the small town of Audubon Springs.

He has a Masters of Library & Information Science (MLIS) from the University of South Carolina and is currently enrolled in a Philosophy program through the University of New Orleans. Woolston plans to continue his research and studies in the field of Philosophy, with an emphasis on Ethics and Ancient Greek Philosophy. His books to date are ATHENAS OWL; Philosophy Articles on Personal Growth, Modern Society & Hollywood Cinema, STOICISM 2.0: How Stoic Philosophy Can Improve Your Lie in the 21st Century, and no w NEOSTOICISM 2.0. Roberts title NEOSTOICISM 2.0 is best understood by the casual reader if the term stoicism is defined  Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD. Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics which is informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting this moment as it presents itself, by not allowing ourselves to be controlled by our desire for pleasure or our fear of pain, by using our minds to understand the world around us and to do our part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others in a fair and just manner. Courtesy of Wikipedia. As Robert opens his exploration of his chosen stoic he states, Neostoicism 2.0 is not so much a type of Philosophy or academic theory. Its a lifestyle. A mentality for daily living. Contained within this book is a complete and concise overview of what Neostoicism truly is. That of being a mentality and lifestyle to be applied by readers in todays modern, 21st Century. While the details of Neostoic philosophy will soon become apparent in the pages that follow, the benefits of applying Neostoicism in your daily life will follow you in ways that you never imagined. All it takes is a willingness and attitude of acceptance to embrace Neostoicism in your life moving forward. Neostoicism 2.0 is broken down into four main topical areas, all of which flow in sequential order. They are the following: Ancient Greek Stoicism, Christianity, Neostoicism 1.0 and Neostoicism 2.0. For readers to fully understand what Neostoic philosophy truly is and how to properly apply it in the modern world, its recommended that each section be read in order. To skip between sections is to miss the chance at fully experiencing the wisdom of Neostoicism as it applies to living a full and virtuous life. First, the section on Ancient Greek Stoicism briefly yet succinctly covers the lives and teachings of the major pioneers of Stoic philosophy from antiquity. Figures profiled in this section include the great Ancient philosophers Diogenes of Sinope, Zeno of Citium, Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius. Second, the section covering Christianity focuses on an overview of Christian history from the time of the early Apostles through the Roman Era and all the way until the commencing of the Middle Ages in Europe. The focus here is on the historical development of the Christian faith, its surrounding environment, profiles of significant Christian philosophers/theologians, and the impact of Christian theology. Third, the section entitled Neostoicism 1.0 details the rise of Neostoicism as a syncretic philosophy of the European Renaissance. Developed by the Belgian philosopher Justus Lipsius in the late 1500s, Neostoicism emerged as a respected and legitimate way of interpretation Christian scripture and theology. Finally, the fourth section is Neostoicism 2.0. Here I personally build upon the prior three sections to add a new and updated version of Neostoic philosophy for the modern, 21st Century. Research-based and illustrated with real world examples, Neostoicism 2.0 will show readers how they can apply this new philosophy in their own lives for sustaining a greater level of personal empowerment and growth. It should be noted that Neostoicism 2.0 is not in any way, shape or form an attempt at disputing or canceling out Christianity with a new religious doctrine. Rather, Neostoicism as described in this book is simply a new form of interpreting Christian scripture/theology from the perspective of Ancient Stoicism. This is a thorough survey of the initial concept of stoicism as well as a demonstration of how the concept has altered through time and how important our inclusion of the principles continues in personal empowerment. The accompanying illustrations introduce art as a significant aspect of understanding the content. The writing has depth but never leaves the reader outside the progress of the journey on which Robert embarks. Genuine food for though and for the soul.

I was a little skeptical going into it because Id never really been into small town girl romances, but I wanted to give it a try because I know Laura is a hoot, and I knew her books would at least entertain me. Also, she gave it to me for free, so there is that, lol. When I first read the book blurb, I was intrigued  sex toys in small town Tennessee? It was either going to be epically, catastrophically terrible or it would be a riot of humor, sensuality, surprises, and a bit of true love. I was so pleased to discover it was the latter. I gave Toying with His Affections a score of 5 out of 5, which I do not give out lightly. Here are my reasons. I appreciated that the heroine, Evie, was strong and independent without being inconsiderate, selfish, self-centered, and an all-around bitch. I HATE writers who think strong and independent are synonymous with bitchy and harpy. If youve read my other reviews, youll see the pattern of dislike mentioned in several posts. Evie, a self-made woman, left Fairview years before to make her own mark on the world, but when her aunt (the woman who raised her after her mother died when she was 8yo) hurts herself and needs help, Evie drops everything and makes the drive from Las Vegas to Fairview -- small town America. I had to hand it to her; I wouldn't have been as willing to drop everything to help, then again, I'm much more cynical and jaded than little goodie two-shoes Evie (who traded in her ballet slippers and Sunday Best for a giant fan headdress and a skimpy costume). I adored the hero, Griff, because he had lived his life of debauchery (if you could call small-town punk mischief debauchery), had served his country bravely, and came out the other side a man worthy of respect, honor, and the adoration of the people in his hometown. There were a lot of misconceptions thrown around by and about each of the main and secondary characters, but those misconceptions weren't just a poorly written plot device used to fill lines of text, they were integral to driving the tension between the heroine and hero, and the heroine and her family and townspeople. The small town Tennessee backdrop is perfect for this book because the fear of little old biddies and spiteful, unhappy housewives and their relentless gossip fueled much of the tension between Evie and Griff. They will talk, you won't get elected Sheriff, everyone thinks Im a slutty showgirl who was too wrapped up in my own desires I couldn't even make it back to town for my own uncles funeral. We cant get involved, I am a slow spreading poison that will kill you one limb at a timestarting with your peniswhich I cant seem to stop thinking about. That was my own Clits Notes version of the situation within the plot that drove said plot for 2/3s of the book. Once Griff made it clear Evie couldn't use his tenuous reputation and her supposed years of glamourous harlotry as an excuse to keep them apart, Evie finally started to wonder if staying in Fairview was a possibility. I gave extra kudo points to Griff for taking the situation by the balls and making an effort to get Evie to stay. Hell, the man even bought a shirt! Nothing says making an effort like purchasing new clothing to impress a woman. Also, he proved that men can be tough as nails but gentle as cotton fluff when the need arises. The man was burned over 20% of his body when an IED exploded next to him in some God-forsaken warzone. Did he whine like a bitch when he was discharged and made to sit around recuperating? No, he sucked up the pain, dealt with the fallout, and made his way home where he charmed a town full of close minded people with long memories and showed them anyone can changeeven small town girls turned Las Vegas showgirls turned sex toy marketers. When Evie needed his support, he gave it to her whole-heartedly, and that made him sexier. The sex party scene was a blast. I read that scene and couldn't shut off the desire to find that website and get my hands on a few of thoseerrcreams. Also, I probably wouldnt mind an introduction to Howard and The Duke. My husband wouldnt mind, LOL! I highly recommend this sweet turns spicy read, and I will be picking up another book by Ms. Curtis in the future.</td><td>Juicy Review -- Toying with His Affections by Laura K.

Few are, in fact I think Jakob understands the Standard Model better than most, judging by his writing. I'm glad I spent the money on this book, it contains a lot of important physical insights as to why the mathematics work the way it does. Not every physics author does this, nor for mathematicians either. It's very nice and it's to be commended, but it's not perfect because it is a bit skimpy on the special relativity, but moreso the section on Lie Algebras and Lie Groups, it's weak although it's a very nice sketch, a true learner will want to fill the theoretical details in with a more advanced text, written by a mathematician, as I have not seen any good ones written by physicists. However, it's the best outline on the standard model I can find, as well as highlighting how Electrodynamics and the classical equations can be derived from group theory and symmetry. So it's very nice, but readers will have to look elsewhere for deeper details on the fundamentals of physics, this book certainly won't do it all but it's a guide, and a quite good one if you read it with a sense of lightness rather than chewing on every word, because he certainly isn't here to dig deep into the foundations and give you the mathematics required. But I can't think of a better text to guide you on your way to understanding the revered Standard Model any better. The section on General Relativity looks pretty bad though, I think his differential geometry is quite weak looking at how it is presented. The author would do good to study some Fibre Bundles and Connections and write a follow up connecting all the topics. Though this may be a bit too ambitious as the foundations of relativity and QM should still be under examination before we go this far.</td><td>You probably want to start here if you're trying to get into the Standard Model</td><td>2017-10-01</td><td>352</td><td>2017</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>67000378</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>2015-09-25</td><td>AOIWZVXXRG54R</td><td>1511595035</td><td>Bex</td><td>This series has been so very interesting to me!

I believe I gave that book a 4 or 5 star review because it was interesting and actually had a plot. That was NOT this book at all. The focus of this book, is in one word - sex. The main character is a Mary Sue - innocent, naive, generous, and completely lacking in personality. She is however, extremely sensual, and Ms. Ng spends the entire book talking about her various sexual exploits with men. I nearly stopped reading when at one point, the author referred to the character's \"mega-breasts\" (her words, not mine) - Really? REALLY? The history of the An Lu Shan rebellion is actually extremely compelling. The aging emperor of China became obsessed with Consort Yang, ignoring his duties to the court and empire. His obsession with her allowed her grasping family to secure lucrative posts at court. They conspired with various factions to obtain wealth and land, while the Emperor's most loyal servants were ignored or turned away. A interesting power struggle existed between the Yang family, Li Linfu (the top governmental official at the time, and the head of an extensive spy network), general An Lu Shan (a barbarian general who ultimately led the rebellion), and the Emperor's life long friend and advisor, the enunch Gao Lishi. The author glosses over all of the political intrigue and epic drama with a few pages - instead spending a good 90% of the book in the bedroom. She also could use a better editor, as her writing contains many mannerisms and errors characteristic of a native Chinese speaker for whom English is a second language. It interrupts the flow, and gives the book a distinctly awkward \"if-you-had-a-conversation-about-sex-with-an-old-lady-in-Chinatown\" quality. I found this book exceedingly awkward to read as a result, and the content was very disappointing. If you are still interested in this subject matter and are looking for a well-written and well researched historical novel, with all the interesting plot twists and intrigue and arresting characters that this book lacked, I would highly recommend \"The Court of the Lion\". If you still want some light reading, but maybe a little less on the sex, and a little bit more historical context and character development, I would recommend Teresa Ng's other book, Mud Blossom instead.</td><td>Worse than a Harlequin novel</td><td>2014-07-28</td><td>396</td><td>2014</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>67000381</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2015-11-08</td><td>A3U16I7C9RAHEH</td><td>B00KXH9HG8</td><td>RaNae Cleverly</td><td>Haven't read yet</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>2015-11-08</td><td>3</td><td>2015</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>67000382</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>2014-12-02</td><td>A2GEMNY50JJ0RQ</td><td>B00KFRWW54</td><td>Nancy Pedersen</td><td>Great first novel!

The first chapter goes through wire types and how to choose the correct wire for your specific project.  The kinds covered are flexible, hard, base metal, German wire, raw wire, craft wires and memory wires.  The second chapter gets into chain techniques. Materials, treatments and styles involved in using chainwork.  Chapter three is about findings: earrings, clasps and others.  Continuing onto chapter four where the tools of jewelry making are explored. From the different kinds of pliers (I had no clue there were various types of pliers) to cutters, wire shaping tools, measuring and polishing tools and storage containers to use for your beading materials. The fifth chapter covers all of the different wire work techniques. Simple loop, Wire-Wrapped Loop, Wire-Wrapped-Bead Cap, Wire-Wrapped Link With Beads, Wire-Wrapped Link-Chain, Briolette Wrap, Covering A Briolette, Making Basic Ear Wires, Making Head Pins and Eye Pins, Making Hoop Earrings, Working With Cones, Memory Wire Methods, Opening & Closing Jump Rings, Using Split Ring Pliers and Wire Cutter Usage.  Wow!  That's a lot of techniques!  Who knew? There is a glossary of terms used throughout the book as well as an appendix listing types of metals. The book is 84 pages packed with all the information you need to get started with techniques using wire for your beaded jewelry projects.  I'd say this is a go-to-book for beaded jewelry for sure! I would recommend this book to any adult looking for information on learning to do beaded jewelry with wirework techniques. There's a lot of information that younger readers may not be able to follow along to, so the age group I would recommend is ages 16 and up.</td><td>A Go-To Book For Beaded Jewelry Making</td><td>2015-04-16</td><td>321</td><td>2015</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>67000390</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2012-02-15</td><td>A3JDPO6DEIHFPC</td><td>B006HLACEU</td><td>Live Outside</td><td>A great twist to a classic has Chad being visited by 3 individuals on the night of his dreams.

What I mean is that if your kid has had an accident or illness requiring emergency room treatment or hospitalization, you are probably frazzled and anxious and scared. In other words, you might not have the time, inclination or even strength to think of things in a straightforward and thought-out manner. This is, above all, a Calm book. Nancy Keene has been involved in health care child advocacy for many years and knows whereof she speaks. Parents who have gone through a child's illness contribute their own stories to the book. One, for example says: \"I told them the first day to treat me like a medical student. I asked them to share all information, current studies, lab results, everything, with me. I told them, in advance, that I hoped they wouldn't be offended by lots of questions, because knowledge was a comfort to me.\" If a doctor, as another parent relates, pats you on the head and says to not worry your head about it, you have the right to insist on the information. And then Keene adds this: \"Don't let anyone talk in front of your child as if she is not there.\" What a great piece of advice, and so easy to forget. One of the themes running through the advice in \"Your Child in the Hospital\" is that you need to give the child as much control (and credit) as is feasible. Maybe she doesn't get to chose whether or not to take a pill. But she can decide whether she wants to take it with chocolate milk or pudding. Keene also gives advice that only an insider might know. For example, if the hospital is a teaching hospital, your child might be visited by large groups of students. This doesn't have to be a bad experience, but if it upsets the child, or if it's just a bad day, you have the right to say no to the group visit. There's also a later chapter on hospital billings. A hospital is a huge bureaucracy. Complicated bills frequently have expensive errors. If you don't have the time to go through each bill thoroughly, perhaps a friend or relative can help you. The only place where I'd make a change in this book is the chapter on dealing with schools and homework. Eight years ago, my straight-A daughter was sick for four months. After we met with the teachers and assistant principal, the school offered her enrollment in an alternative college-prep school where she met with the teachers only once a week. This was invaluable, as she could not attend regular school. To my horror, though, I recently heard from a teacher that the mother of a similarly ill student was not being told of this option, or of even the Home Hospital option - the teacher felt that the school district was not volunteering the information because these options are expensive for it. So, I would recommend to Nancy Keene that her wording, regarding parents' advocating with the school, be stated more strongly. Do not assume the school will tell you what options you have - to be fair, it could be that the teachers think administration is contacting you and administration may assume that if you don't ask you don't need it. The parent may need to ask and may even need to be a pest. But it will be worth it. My daughter, for example, may have had to repeat 9th grade without the alternative school. As someone who's had two kids with hospital stays, I found \"Your Child in the Hospital\" a great book - one that would have been helpful at the time. I received a free copy of \"Your Child in the Hospital\" for review.

With a empty bank account Simone can't resist. So with boyfriend, Kevin, in tow they arrive in Miami. However not everything is normal, especially when Simone finds a dead body in her mother's fridge - a dead body that has an uncanny resemblance to her boyfriend, Kevin. It seems Simone and Kevin have fallen into a trap, but who has set out to frame Kevin? It will take Simone and Kevin all they've got to try and solve this one and keep Kevin out of jail! I'm a big fan of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum Mysteries, and when I heard this series was written in the same vein as Stephanie Plum I absolutely couldn't resist giving it a go. As an Australian by birth, I absolutely loved the concept of Simone and her family being from Sydney, Australia and relocating to Miami, Florida. After all who wouldn't love all the sunshine and fun that Florida has to offer? Well apart from the crime, drug smugglers and the murder Simone is about to discover. Spitting Image was an absolute laugh a minute, with all the hijinx that Simone and Kevin manage to get into, as they try to solve the murder. From the first chapter to the last it was laughs, mystery and mayhem and I'm so glad that I discovered this indie title. If you love a good dose of mayhem and comedy with your cozy mystery, I highly recommend this Florida-based cozy mystery.</td><td>If you enjoy Stephanie Plum mysteries you're sure to love this one!</td><td>2012-11-22</td><td>274</td><td>2012</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>67000404</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>2013-04-19</td><td>AKFZXNQTN74N7</td><td>B000MPNZN2</td><td>generic_odowd</td><td>I've had my copy so long the paperback is marked 60 cents!

I have worked with students with \"severe\" autism for 13 years and have read stacks of books on the subject from various points of view (parents, siblings, therapists, teachers, doctors and those with autism). Rarely do I find anything ground shifting along the way. THIS BOOK IS THE EXCEPTION. As I journeyed further and further into the book, I felt like I was invited into Alice's Wonderland or better yet Iris' Wonderland. I immediately jumped on board and was taken on a roller coaster ride through autism - the ups, the downs, the turns, the twists, the loops and finally a return to the station of \"our world.\" What a thrill to be in the front coaster car for this journey of autism told by someone who lived through this roller coaster ride and found her strengths which enbabled her to eventually become a highly sought-out mentor, consultant, lecturer and workshop leader. Meanwhile, she is still proudly her unique self. This book - which I consider to be a treasure box - is so full of gems that you are sure to gain insight in many ways. From birth, Iris' unique and sometimes disturbing (for us \"typicals\") ways were seen by medical and educational pofessionals as congnitive eficiencies or psychosis. However, her father knew Iris better and refused to accept that Iris had intellectual challenges. He proceeded to move forward by helping his daughter break through her issues through acceptance, understanding, clever ideas and tough love. Her father and many other mentors along her path assisted Iris in building her strengths, supporting her challenges and cheering her successes. And this was in a time and a place where resources in this area were scarce. This 440 page book (which was translated from Swedish into English by Karl Nordling) is broken down into six rather thick chapters covering various parts of Iris' life journey. Personally, I had a tough time reading through chapter one as it is a bit confusing and doesn't flow as well as I expected. Part of Iris' life are repeated here and there throughout the book which makes some portions a bit disconnected. However, it's worth continuing to dive in page by page as you will soon be rewarded with amazing insight. Once I got to the second chapter, I had a hard time putting the book down. I wrote notations in many margins and highlighted much of the book which is chock full of priceless information. I believe that this book should be required reading for any profession with staff who teach or support individuals on the autism spectrum. By the end of the book, Iris' examples and visual ideas are so easy-to-follow and understand that they can assist us in interacting and teaching those with autism. I quickly saw Iris Johansson as a Swedish equivalent of our American treasure, Temple Grandin. Although each have a different background and skill set, they have many parallels in their journeys to personal and professional success. Being able to see what helped them succeed within autism (especially during the years of the 1940s through 1970s) is priceless. Thank you Iris for sharing your journey to help open our eyes and understanding. Thank you for Karl Nordling for translating this and making these treasured insights available to those in America.

I'm sure the author used the words \"tiny house\" a couple of times but the author's definition and my definition of tiny house are definitely two different things. If anything, the book is about de-cluttering your house. This is a book that has been translated into English from another language, and it reads a though it were translated directly by Bing or another internet translator. The sentence structures are painfully awkward in English. From chapter 1: \"Spring cleaning or cleaning because of guests/events tends to be rather deep, thorough, and precise, that de-cluttering, cleanliness, and health becomes a part of our vitality to all movement and rest.\" If I think about it, I can see what the author is saying, but I don't want to re-read every sentence to try to get the gist of the thought. The author talks about terminating your clutter. I was never sure exactly what he meant by that. I wasn't sure if he meant that we should throw things away or that when we organize, we terminate the clutter. From the section titled Four Boxes: \"This idea relies on the fact that awareness of the elimination, culmination and termination is necessary to experience life and its zillion things, in whole.\" It is just too difficult to determine exactly what the author means. There was one thing that I found interesting, although the author didn't go into any detail. I have never read another de-cluttering book that suggests that you name your home. I liked the thought of that. If I give my home a thoughtful name that has meaning to me, I might begin to treat my home and my things better. My friends who ranch tell me that they never name the animals that will be butchered because when an animal has a name, it becomes special. Only their pets have names. It may be that way with a home. If a house has a name, it becomes special and perhaps we take better care of it. I think that makes a bit of sense. This is a book about de-cluttering your house, regardless of the title, which I find is extremely misleading. If you are looking for information about living in a tiny house, as pictured on the cover, you need to look elsewhere. I don't know what language this was originally written in, but if you are looking for helpful information about de-cluttering. this book is probably best read in the original language.</td><td>A struggle to read</td><td>2015-04-21</td><td>447</td><td>2015</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>67000411</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2016-12-31</td><td>A4KZD6UWZT579</td><td>B01770SL9C</td><td>karen flemming</td><td>I am using these for a mason jar paint sprayer I purchased.

In Dracula: Sense And Nonsense, Miller (to use her own words) \"...challenges dozens of errors and misconceptions about Bram Stoker and his famous novel...\" The book is divided into five main chapters which cover: the sources for the novel, Stoker's writing of his classic, the novel itself, the geography covered in the book and Vlad the Impaler. A sixth chapter covers the strengths and weaknesses of other (non-fiction) books that deal with the novel Dracula in some form (bios of Stoker, studies of the novel, etc.) Each chapter is also extensively annotated. In each of the first five chapters, Miller quotes an error or misconception surrounding the chapter subject, gives the source for the quote and then presents her evidence as to why the quote is \"poppycock\" (one of my favorite expressions used in the book). Ms. Miller sprinkles some welcome humor into the book with her initial reaction(s) against given quotes. Also, you can tell that every explanation was carefully and thoroughly researched. One comes away with an immense respect for the time, effort and thought that she put into presenting her case. Her writing is succinct and scholarly, although never written above the heads of her readers. To truly appreciate the importance of this book, a little explanation is in order. Bram Stoker kept an incredibly comprehensive record concerning the origins and sources for the writing of Dracula, many times known as his \"working notes and papers\". These notes were discovered in the Seventies. Thus, to establish any true facts concerning the novel, one need only look at the novel itself and Stoker's notes. Any information or \"facts\" that do/did not make use of these notes (since their discovery), can truly only be considered theories or assumptions. In debunking the myths and errors related in her book, Miller uses Stoker's notes as her evidence. If the proof for one of the quoted \"facts\" cannot be found within said notes, Miller (correctly) identifies it hearsay, improbable, misinformed, or just plain incorrect. Of the many inaccuracies Miller corrects, perhaps no other will cause more controversy than her severing the ties between the fictional Count and the real-life Vlad Tepes. According to the author, Stoker merely borrowed the name Dracula and any statement of fact that Stoker based his vampire Count (or even had much knowledge) on the bloodthirsty Vlad is irresponsible. Many more deep-seated, but less shocking assumptions and beliefs will likely be shattered by this book. This won't be an easy book for many devoted fans of the novel. Old established beliefs can be hard to shake and many may simply dig in their feet and refuse to accept Miller's rebuttals. But serious fans of the novel owe it to themselves to give this book a reading. Miller only presents the best possible evidence: what Stoker himself wrote concerning the origins of his book.

The story starts twenty years later where she returns to Oberon to tidy up her inheritance from her recently deceased step-mother - the same step-mother who sent her away - and the story kicks off straightaway, with the towns' gossips, old enemies, and her old flame. The plot had my head reeling. I had everyone as a suspect as the murderer, if there even was one, but new evidence turned up at every turn. But with Marsha's abilities to read peoples tea leaves, she gets snippets of what might be... the entanglement of magic in this book was beautifully done, making it very believable. I just loved the plot; I was turning pages so fast, pointing fingers and then taking it back. What a great read. The love story was very well written, with enough pushing and shoving... two very stubborn people who suited each other down to the ground. There was a particular scene that I just loved, when she first sets eyes on Nick again after twenty years... the description had my hands sweating as I struggled to hold the kindle, it was so realistic, I just got the feeling the author described to a T. Characters: Scout: Scout what can I say, a damaged, tormented woman, but with pride and a stubbornness that could be the only reason for her grasp on her sanity, even though I questioned it several times in the book, but loved her as an MC. She was strong yet vulnerable, very well-rounded main character, and I loved that Nick was her old flame, they just couldn't have been picked any better. Marsha I loved: she reminded me of a wise old crone. She always had a second meaning to everything she said, and her ability to see auras read tea leaves and pick up on emotions was priceless. She seemed to have her own little private jokes along the way, and was always sticking her nose in everyone's business. At first I didn't like Lucy. I found her stubborn and righteous and several times I was just hoping someone would shut her up, but as the story progressed, I began to understand the passion she had for her family, and why she seen Scout as the enemy. So overall I just loved this book. It was very enjoyable and I would highly recommend it for those who love a good murder mystery with a dash of magic and a good splash of romance. murder with a dash of magic, and a good splash of romance.</td><td>Scent of the Roses.

If you're new to Jay, I would learn everything you can from him. In 2008, there aren't many people that have as big of a competitive advantage over their competitors as Jay does. I bought the MasterMind Marketing System last year. Some great points: -Strategy of preeminence. -Three ways to grow a business model -You attitude. This alone is worth a 100x the price of the course if you use it. -He goes through a list of top headlines and modifys them to your own situation. Absolutely brilliant. -The section on creating breakthroughs. Getting trade journals. The examples he gives are great, \"Jay Abraham's bottled water shop and water bar\" example. I bought the set last year. It's so layered, I've listened to it several times and learn something new each time. It's a lot of work, but I'd consider transcribing it, there's so much information. Comes to about a 120 pages in Microsoft Word. There are so many great examples, it's easy to miss them on audio. He gives an example in section two of analyzing sales people. It's easy to miss a few sentences, but they can be profound...\"Why is it written that a sales man or woman has to be a master at all trades?\" Then he goes through some examples. \"Well, why would everybody operate mediocre?\" It's profound when you step back from it. And look at it through his lense of optimization and leverage. The set is a mix of studio and live recording from seminars. Clearly a master teacher, we're a lucky audience.</td><td>Profound, life changing</td><td>2008-07-11</td><td>361</td><td>2008</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>67000445</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2017-04-25</td><td>A20ZFMJFQJNHN7</td><td>1530414121</td><td>Wertherian.</td><td>I read a review that objected to the sex scenes...what a laugh...the work Risque in the title should have been a clue.  why does one assume that sex and lust is a modern human experience ...ok rant over...lol.

With the title story, a voyeuristic old man watches the movement of strangers in and out the cottage across the alleyway;  a young woman settles in, to work her garden, her laundry and enchantment leading  him only to move from his perch to the cottage on her departure. Life is enriched with the extension of friendship from the caring, kind pizza lady to the would-be robber who enters her shop only to return again and again until his life style and health fade and it is Farewell to Jessie.  The Torch Singer finds love at first sight as her music evokes mood and reveals her inner self. Poetry abounds in Ms. Schroeder's work as in Nocturnal Journal where ...\"a custard pudding moon  rose above the steppes, a round yolk against the splashes of beaten egg white clouds.\" Several stories stand out as unique bits on the human condition. The Meddling Mailman frets over an old lady's many rejections of her writing and, in their secret collusion, takes it upon himself to edit and submit her work to win her a  place in the world of words.  Nymph Tale has the flavor of old time fairy stories in the exploration of two lost gypsy kids. Another and absolutely beautiful cross-generational story is told in Last Waltz, my personal favorite. An experienced and multi-published writer, Anne Schroeder's GIFTS OF RED POTTERY are a welcome addition to her wide range of work.

I have not read a story with such great voice in a LONG time. And once I was there, the characters and story gripped me every page of the way. I really felt connected to the characters and felt them all to be believable, and more than that, found the relationships BETWEEN character and the various relationship dynamics to be believable as well. Its something special when you can fall into a book like thatfall into the whole world, believe the characters and the situations, however otherworldly they get at times.

The author's descriptive and crisp writing bring the reader right into the imaginary world of Scotland in the ancient days of knights and magic. The scenes of fighting and war are handled with gut-wrenching precision that kept me cringing as well as turning the pages to find out what happened next. Matt is an extremely likable hero and his dog, Mia, is one of my favorite characters. The original plot deftly combines science fiction and fantasy, and I think that this talented author would have been able to pull off an exciting story even without incorporating the King Arthur legend. Fans of King Arthur and Merlin who appreciate that story (in its various forms) more than I do may find that those elements just add another exiting layer to the action.

Rebels are always interesting to me and in this case, Augustus has a lot to rebel against as there are a lot of bad guys that he encounters. There is an additionat metaphysical plot in this book that I will not give away but that makes the book even funner to read.

I couldn't help wondering what readers would think if this book had been written about true faith instead of all that \"in the moment\" stuff and \"the trees talk to me\"\".  It would have been snarled at as \"too religious\". So, be warned, you are subtly  trying to be indoctrinated with one woman's personal philosophy of life. Patricia could be a good writer.  Flashes of better-than-good writing flicker through the pages, but she will have to decide who she is- a philosopher who has her own philosophy and wants to share it, or a  French-woman  wanna-be .

Kiley</td><td>This excellent volume, superbly documented, paints a realistic, grim, and  completely readable picture of the Grande Armee's retreat from Moscow.  Much new information has been uncovered and used, and this is one of the  best books on the subject available today in English.  The third of three  books by the same author on the Russian campaign, it tells the tale of one  of the most tragic and gripping events of the Napoleonic Wars. The  retreat was gruesome.  During it, Napoleon reached his nadir as a soldier,  but somewhere, possibly during one of the running fights with Cossacks or  other Russian irregulars, he regained his identity and courage, and got the  remnants of his army out of Russia, the survivors he later proudly  nicknamed his 'men of bronze.' Without a doubt, the French and allied  survivors were the toughest men in the Grande Armee by virtue of their  getting out of Russia.  The best and proudest moment for all concerned,  except the Russians of course, was the assault crossing of the Berezina  River, the last obstacle facing the Grande Armee on its way home. Chased  by two, and the river line held by another Russian army, the  professionalism and stark fighting qualities of Napoleon's soldiers sorted  themselves out and they executed a flawless operation, defeating two  Russian armies and outrunning a third.  Building the bridges they needed as  they went, they fought their way across against almost overwhelming numbers  of men and guns, the French and their trusted allies, Swiss, Germans, and  Poles, outfighting their Muscovite opponents and leaving Russia as  victors. This story has many eyewitnesses, doctors, privates, generals,  colonels, and one French actress.  They tell of the horror and suffering,  of high deeds, and the hopelessness of the snow covered vastness that is  Russia in the winter. This book is excellent, and along with its two  partners, deserves wider reading.

First, there's the metal itself - silvery (modern alloys hold their shine), very affordable, and hugely workable. I have some expereince raising copper and silver, and would love to get back to forging. Then, the author gives a great intro to the working techniques unique to pewter. It forms easily and doesn't need annealing, since its annealing temperature is below room temperature. It solders and even welds at temperatures far below silver and such. Mandel's tip about bismuth-tin solder sounds interesting, too, since its melting point is far less than pewter's - a fact appealing to anyone who's melted a workpiece while hard soldering. The \"gallery\" aspect of this book offers plenty of inspiration to a wide range of tastes, too. Still, I found this book somewhat frustrating. After showing how easily pewter can be formed using a modest and accessible set of tools, her first three projects all involve a hydraulic press - not something you see in every hobbyist's workshops, or even in most small professional studios. I find her use of an oxy-gas torch on pewter startling, too. That flame can melt metals at 2000F and up, so seems like overkill for something a soldering iron can weld. (I'll have to try it myself and see if the fineness of the flame mitigates its intense heat, but I expect to melt a lot of practice pieces.) I know that retailers come and go, but the bismuth-tin alloy is a bit exotic - a pointer to Rotometals d.o.t com would have been welcome. And the index? Don't bother. So, my impression ends up thoroughly mixed. Mandel clearly knows her subject, and offers many valuable pointers, like the importance of avoiding cross-contamination with your other metlawork. Her sections on technique seem easy to follow, despite lack of obvious connection between text and photos (would it have been so hard to number them?). On the other hand, she seems to have forgotten what kind of tools a beginner is likely to have access to. This book offers the best intro I know to this wonderful metal, but it could have been a lot better. -- wiredweird</td><td>Almost great</td><td>2010-08-14</td><td>363</td><td>2010</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>67000478</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2013-08-01</td><td>A39B58G7PGX2UR</td><td>615854311</td><td>Percival Constantine</td><td>I first read Dillon and the Voice of Odin ten years ago in its initial run.

With Dillon, Derrick Ferguson has created a character who is capable of drawing readers in with a mixture of roguish charm and near-superhuman heroics. If you've read the original, you might be wondering whether or not you should buy this new edition and my response to that is you definitely should. For starters, the entire book has been tightened and errors that slipped through in the original edition have been removed in this. Second, it also kicks off with a new Dillon tale that fits in with this story and helps set the tone for the entire book. And third, the excellent cover designed by Sean E. Ali. I mention that because the cover of the original edition was probably the weakest thing about that release.

The scant musical decorum unnecessarily suggests a particular historical and cultural context, and thus, in my view, contradicts the universality of the message of the Psalms.

There is a modern tragedy occurring in psychotherapeutic offices throughout the land. Many patients are being treated as sick and diseased human beings who are for all practical purposes irretrievably abnormal. The thesis of this work is that psychotherapy can only be successful when the patient is treated as an equal. This is a very profound statement. Many patients enter treatment with the unconscious belief that they are flawed, that their perceptions are grossly distorted, and in fact the therapists are happy to confirm this by enforcing their rigid theories of the patients unconscious on the patient. The therapist claims access to a completely undistorted view of reality that the patient is lacking (thus \"flawed\"). Dorpat astutely recognizes the importance of Weiss proposal that \"psychopathology stems from unconscious pathogenic beliefs of the dangers if the patient were to pursue certain important goals.\" This is an amazing work that should be of central importance to anyone involved in any way with psychotherapy (students, teachers, therapists, patients, etc.).

Having read many books on the 8th AF over the years, I was hoping this wouldn't be a rehashing of what I'd previously read.  I'm happy to say it wasn't. The book concentrates solely on the bombers of the 8th AF, with very little attention paid to the fighters or the other American air forces in Europe, although they all do get a little bit of a mention here and there.  Some units, such as the 100th BG, get a bit more ink than others, but that's to be expected--not every group can get the same amount of coverage.  There is a great amount of personal recollections in the book, and not just from pilots but from aircrew and groundcrew as well. Designed to be a force of daylight, high-altitude precision bombers, the 8th went through some very troublesome growing pains.  High losses and the unlikely odds of actually completing a combat tour of 25 missions lead to questions of morale, leadership and the very concept of daylight precision bombing.  All of these topics are discussed in detail, and although hindsight is 20/20, I feel the author did a good job of presenting things fairly and showing the historical context of the situations.  There are really good chapters on the POW experience and the issue of 8th AF bombers landing in neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland. A comparison of the British bombing campaign and leadership with that of the Americans is a common thread throughout the book.  Both sides wished to defeat the Germans, but had very different ideas about how to do it.  The British preferred to bomb by night and they put a fair amount of pressure upon the Americans to join them, but the Americans stuck to daylight bombing and in the end received vindication of their efforts. The book concludes with an examination of tactics and results, especially those found by the United States Strategic Bombing Survey conducted after the war and from interviews conducted with several high-ranking Germans such as Erhard Milch, Albert Speer, Herman Goering and Adolf Galland. A very enjoyable book which gives a good overall picture of the war fought by the bombers of the 8th AF, along with a fair amount of detail.  Definitely worth adding to any aviation or World War II library.</td><td>Bombing Hitler's Festung Europa</td><td>2014-06-30</td><td>410</td><td>2014</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>67000513</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2014-08-24</td><td>A19K89YO80WBGV</td><td>B004AYD5ZO</td><td>Georgina</td><td>Very good, solid, helpful information!

It made me realize how important odor is for me. I cannot think of anybody else who wrote so extensively and knowingly about the importance of our ability to smell.  It is a very original and unique book. It made me realize that I chose my lovers with my nose.  I also realize that I cannot stand some people because of their scent. Not that they stink, I just do not like their particular body odor.  Since I read this book - and I read it many times and also saw the movie several times, I planted my garden with lots of fragrant plants. I bought many new perfumes and I stop so much more often to smell the roses. I prepare food which will not only appeal to my taste buds and eyes but also to my nose. I also love the book because of its historical content.  Suesskind transports us in a Paris and France that gives us a whiff of the stench, which many who could afford it, covered up with perfume.  His description of his main character possessed with his mission to create the best perfume in the world is absolutely fascinating and I could not put the book down.</td><td>Get a whiff of this one</td><td>2011-07-26</td><td>220</td><td>2011</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>67000515</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>2015-07-19</td><td>A3VSCCW1FN11B7</td><td>1514667770</td><td>Jodie</td><td>That certainly was a twist in a story I haven't come across before.

In this, the third in the Macabre Collection, author David Haynes proves once again he can set a scene in few words that is so atmospheric it makes you shiver.  The descriptions, dialogue and overall feel of this novella are so authentic that it is an absolute pleasure to read. The book sees the return of Fettiplace and his despicable acts are once again on display.  What we find this time though is that there is some sort of horrific method to his madness.  We follow the main character, Matthew Napier, right from the beginning with the death of his father and it is a miserable life that is narrated.  What makes it so interesting and unsettling is that, like Matthew, the reader is in the dark much of the time.  What lies around the corner is unknown and at several points I was almost dreading it! At the end of the book and before writing this review, I was hovering between four and five stars.  But then I read the last few pages again (where all is revealed in twists I did not see coming) and let the revelations sink in.  In a delayed reaction (!) the power of this book hit me and I realised how everything had been leading up to the grotesque finale without me even realising it.  The book is a five-star hit and I have been left with disturbing images ingrained in my mind.  I cannot imagine this genre of story better written.

Each of them illustrate the value of working together for a goal and one emphasizes that being different can be good. I love books for children that contain teaching moments and in this book there are several opportunities available.  There are 'big' words such as 'reassuring, solution, reaction and shattered' that may require an explanation to the younger ones.  I also thought that in the ;Legendary Valley of Bamboo' that perhaps a little one might question the reason that the bamboo is disappearing.  And, of course, the poaching of the beautiful pandas. So, cooperation with others, being different is OK and an increase in the vocabulary of the little ones are all contained in this one.  Doesn't get much better than this in a short book, does it?

She's excellent at character building and the reader can see inside the minds of the primary characters and begin to sympathize with them or take exception to their maneuverings.  In this storyline, one could certainly sympathize with Vanessa and even greatly admire her willingness to face off her mother, Lady Cecilia, who had never shown any maternal feelings for Vanessa.  Rather, Lady Cecilia was a selfish woman who hated living in the country and once her husband passed, all she could think about was moving back to London.  However, she was stymied in that Vanessa had full charge of the estate and monies and Lady Cecily's portion would not be given into her hands until Vanessa married.  Because Vanessa refuses to put off mourning early and move to London ahead of the Season, Lady Cecilia decides she must find a husband for Vanessa among the local gentry, ultimately choosing three gentlemen upon which she will focus her machinations. We are then treated to a sampling of what is available in the country and to the reader's point of view, certainly none of the gents are quite good enough for our Vanessa (at least as they are presented), who is lovely, has a great mind and  is very involved in the running of the estate.  She's a superb horsewoman and soon takes up with a childhood friend on her daily rides who just happens to be one of the men Lady Cecily has in mind as a candidate.  This gent is large, handsome and a bruising rider.  However, his eligibility as a potential groom  is somewhat questionable because he seems to have suffered an injury of some sort which has left him a bit simpleminded.  He poses a quandary to Vanessa and quite frankly, to the reader.  However, since the other gents are most certainly not up to snuff, we have a glimmer of suspicion the brain injury might be a deception to put off the locals in order to conduct some other type of business. For indeed, there is a smuggling operation going on in which the local excise men are hot to stop.  Into this mix, everyone's worlds will eventually collide and Vanessa will unexpectedly find her man.  Of course, all of the romance bits and pieces are not even engaged until toward the very end.  I've found Gayle Buck's style in this regard to be similar to Heyer's in some respects when it comes to putting off any real romance between the H/h until the very end of the book.  Not always, but often.</td><td>Good Characters - Very Little Romance</td><td>2015-12-12</td><td>457</td><td>2015</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>67000596</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2015-04-10</td><td>A3AFZJ407FIEB5</td><td>1495419061</td><td>sydney</td><td>Loved this story!!

Have you ever started out disliking something, grew to appreciate it, then loathe it, have it grow on you once more, become ready to throw it away, and finally put it down, wait a few days, and then say, \"I'm not sure what I read, but it just might be brilliant?\" This, in a nutshell, was my experience reading \"A Galaxy At War\" by John Fitch V. \"A Galaxy At War\" is the story of Ryann Germayne, a pilot for the GFS (Galaxy of Free Systems).  It seems that the GFS rules its universe with a sort of aluminum fist.  It makes demands on the planets under its control and will not let them govern themselves, and yet though most of the book they seem a bit weak and pathetic for what is portrayed as a powerful political entity. Long story short, the Rebels are fighting back against the cruel rule of the GFS, and Ryann and his wife, Joslyne, who is the gunner on their ship, The Tub, traverse space, trying to hold back the Rebels any way they can. At first, I thought this book was a parody.  There are so many clichs throughout the first third of it.  You have the witty banter between Ryann and Joslyne (\"hotshot\" and \"flyboy\"?), a robot assistant who can speak hundreds of languages, and political intrigue that really isn't that intriguing.  Add to this the humor that comes from the overuse of the term \"photonics\" (why is it red and green and what does that mean?) and the fact that everyone's favorite drink is \"stimu-tonic\" (what, coffee's not good enough in space?) and you have the perfect ingredients for satire. However, after a while, those elements disappear and the tone becomes muddled.  Allegiances flip-flop for seemingly no reason at all.  There are severely over-explained plans that are far from complex and yet presented as such.  During this time, I seriously considered putting down the book. Come the end, I was glad I didn't. Something strange happened along the way while I was rolling my eyes at the text.  All of a sudden the tone became dark and serious, and the writing reflected as such.  The characters' previous actions began to make sense.  It all came upon me quickly, as if I hadn't been paying attention the whole time and it only just then popped into my brain and screamed at me to look closer.  It became more than a space opera, turning into something meaningful, something that would make the 9/11 conspiracy theorists proud. So I didn't write my review immediately afterwards and sat on the book for a few days.  In that time, it's gained greater notoriety in my head.  The themes make sense, and the humor does, too.  I think I finally understand what Mr. Fitch was trying to accomplish with it, and in the opinion of this reviewer he pulled it off. In other words, try out A Galaxy At War.  By the time you're done, I think you'll have enjoyed it...though it might take a while to figure out why you did.</td><td>It sneaks up on you...</td><td>2010-07-12</td><td>551</td><td>2010</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>67000599</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2016-01-14</td><td>ASSPJ5DE2VVN0</td><td>B005D7JNDA</td><td>Southern Charm</td><td>Touching Once everything came together was just amazing.

I expected the book would focus on the North American College as an organization, but rather it describes six new seminarians during the 1995-96 academic year, going into a great deal of detail about their backgrounds and their spiritual journeys while at the College. It's as though the six came from central casting - the introverted Asian immigrant, the ex-fighter pilot, the homesick farm kid from the prairies, the high-living New Orleans lawyer, and a pair of identical twins. These are a conservative bunch, both in the sense of US politics as well as in terms of accepting traditional church doctrine. Most of them are constantly wrestling with their \"calling\" - essentially their turmoil over renouncing sex forever - and the endless pages devoted to their inner ruminations do get tedious after awhile. Despite its flaws, I found the book entertaining to read. I was surprised that two of the six seminarians had ongoing romantic relationships back in the US. The saddest part was when one of the seminarians tells his girlfriend over the phone that it's over, while she genuinely thought his enrollment in seminary was a passing fling.

Filled with a lot of date on the standard 'conspiracy' fare, coupled with a Rip van Winkle element/twist, the massive amount of data on the Illuminati, Jewish banking interests, Media bias, and police brutality took up a lot of preamble, before the book got interesting. The author clearly is a younger man, as his obligatory and somewhat vulgar 'sex scenes' were all written from the male perspective, with little insight into a woman's psyche, and there was so little character development at first, and such a mess of 'false identities' assumed by the 'Popsicle Man,' I was ready to stop reading. Then, about the middle of the novel, things got interesting. The change of locales from desert metropolises to the environs of Prescott made for a nice change. The Military intervention was just enough to interest someone who finds all that machismo, boring. But the best parts were the vicarious elements in the PTB getting their own back, double! I was rooting for the 'good guys' all during that last half of the book. Thus, four stars. For someone who has not read widely on alternative, and secretive elements of non-European societies, this book puts it all out there for you. From a data standpoint, it is worth the four stars, and the e-reader price. Just the thought of 'the One' rotting in jail for high crimes and misdemeanors, made my day! Bravo!

Trust me, you dont. Cover Him With Darkness is one hell of a wild, sexy ride. This book has more twists than a corkscrew, and none of them felt artificial. Ashbless takes us from the high mountains of central Europe to Boston to Burning Man, and shes such an excellent writer that I truly mean takes us. I could feel the sand of the Nevada desert beneath bare feet and the chop of the waves on the Mediterranean. To say nothing of the intense, erotic, and imaginative sex And somewhere along the way, between the dozens of plot twists and the Kindle-melting erotica, this novel raises some enormous questions: What does it mean to love someone? What loyalty do we owe family, tradition, and the pull of our own hearts? How shall we balance compassion with justice? Damn, if Dostoevsky wrote smolderingly hot erotica about fallen angels, hed be Janine Ashbless.

Some popular science books are good; for instance, Simon Singh's \"Big Bang\" is fun to read and one learns many things in it. But many popular science books, and almost all popular science articles (about black holes, or the Large Hadron Collider, or wormholes, or quantum mechanics), teach one nothing more than cocktail conversation; one hears some words, and comes away with no solid knowledge, even at a basic level. Of course it is hard to digest and assimilate topics into your brain, otherwise one wouldn't spends years at university learning science, but it is possible to focus on a topic and give the reader solid knowledge about it at a level below that of a disciplinary textbook, and Ben-Naim's book does this well. Ben-Naim's book assumes that the reader has some familiarity with high school level physics, chemistry, and calculus; some probability would be useful also, as far as having seen the normal distribution. The reader assuredly does not need to know any statistical mechanics or thermodynamics or information theory. It is better for our own understanding and the clarity of science to be upfront with topics we are confused by, in this case entropy. Nothing has to be easy and some things take years of preparation to understand, but if the only answer someone can give about entropy or another topic is \"do lots of exercises with it and then you will understand it\", this is a sign that the standard presentations of the topic are confused. For the reader with serious mathematical preparation who wants to follow the topics in Ben-Naim's book further, I strongly recommend Khinchin's \"Mathematical Foundations of Information Theory\".</td><td>Basing statistical mechanics on information theory</td><td>2014-04-19</td><td>308</td><td>2014</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>67000642</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2014-09-07</td><td>A3VSFBA4LDH96Z</td><td>1500557072</td><td>Mandus</td><td>Comic at its best!

She's running with her little brother from the nightmare that killed her parents. She keeps going because she knows that the people who are after her little brother have all kinds of vile intentions for him. The running is wearing her down and she has begun to realize that she can't do this on her own any longer. She has to start seeking out the protector that her mother told her about in her final letter to her. Gabriel is a grigori (warrior.) He is part of the Etruscan race born to protect the streghe (witch.) Gabriel is very persistent in his search to find and eliminate the family who cursed a specific group of thirteen streghe nearly five hundred years ago. His frustrations are running very high as Dario and the rest of his Malandante minions consistently stay one step ahead of him. I love how Gabriel and Shea come together, both after the exact same thing, for completely different reasons. He is attempting to put an end to a curse. She has no clue what curse he is talking about. He believes that if she is truly who she claims to be then she should just know what she is. I liked the way the romantic built up in Spell Bound. Shea and Gabriel throw sparks from the very beginning, but it takes some time for them to see what exactly can become of those sparks. Julian has also woven a complex plot into this tale. I felt like I got more of the Etruscan world with this book than I have with other books set in this world. This curse has affected numerous individuals over the course of the past five hundred years. It was interesting to read about how the curse affected the different secondary characters and not just the main characters. The cast of secondary characters were fantastic. I would love to know more about them all. I'm hoping Julian goes more in depth into their lives in future books. Quinn's life is so terribly heartbreaking. To know that he is someone's blood bound mate, for that person to deny him, and for him to know all the reasons he is denied and still he wants to be with her. Matt has to have an interesting past. He is blunt and to the point. His fellow grigori brothers all think him a bit crazy. Leo, even though he is just a child played a fairly large role in Spell Bound. It would be interesting to see where all of his extraordinary abilities take him once he is an adult. I can easily see Leo having an incredible book. I'll be keeping my fingers crossed! I know I've said this numerous times before but I really love Julian's magical Etruscan world. Each book in each of her series' gives readers a taste of this world from a different magical beings perspective. The series' are loosely tied to each other, readers can definitely read one series without reading the others. If you've never read any of her books before this would be an easy place to start. I can guarantee that you'll soon have read all of her different series'. ***authors note at the end states that Spell Bound takes place before Seduced by Magic.

It is nothing less than a one-volume history of Poland from 1944-1947. It provides so much detail in just one book, and includes such things as pictures of then-General Eisenhower's visit to Poland. Lane devotes some detail to the double-dealing of Roosevelt behind the Poles' backs. The sellout of Poland included President Roosevelt openly lying to Polish-American leader Charles Rozmarek, even using a prewar map of Poland as part of the deception (p. 96). Throughout his travels across Poland, Lane was keenly aware of the terror created by the Communist secret police (U. B., or UB). He was well aware of the fact that free elections were unimaginable under such circumstances, long before the farcical elections of January 17, 1947 that officially brought the Communists to power. Soon thereafter, Lane would not take it any more. He resigned his position as ambassador in order that he could freely speak to Americans about the crime of betrayal that had been done to Poland. Lane (p. 181) pointed out that the definition of a Fascist was often very elastic: \"...that some well-informed persons had even gone so far as to define a Fascist as a person not in one hundred per cent agreement with Communism.\" Left-wingers had used the term Fascist in this manner since time immemorial. Lane also includes a statement of Stalin saying that, whatever the negative American response, Americans will soon forget about it and move on to other things (p. 312). Ah, the more things change, the more they remain the same! Lane provides some detail on the so-called Kielce Pogrom (pp. 246-251). He remarks: \"But almost all sources agreed that the militia had been responsible to a great extent for the massacre, not only in failing to keep order but in the actual killing of the victims, for many had been shot or bayoneted to death...(p. 248). Yet no members of the militia had been brought to trial...the underlying cause of the pogrom was the growing anti-Semitism which, even our Jewish sources admitted, was caused by the great unpopularity of the Jews in key government positions. These men included Minc, Berman, Olszewski (whose real name was said to be Specht), Radkiewicz and Spychalski...It was known, furthermore, that both the U. B. and K. B. W. [Communist secret police] had, among their members, many Jews of Russian origin. (pp. 250-251).\" Lane (p. 251) suspects that the \"unbelievably inefficient\" manner in which the militia and the U. B. (Bezpieka, or UB) had handled this situation points to at least some degree of conspiracy. Otherwise, Lane does not address the issue of whether or not those \"mob\" members clubbing the Jews were themselves planted Communist agents. He does point out that accusations of the \"tardy response of the Church\" had been fueled by the coincidental absence of the Bishop of Kielce, Monsignor Kaczmarek (p. 249). If indeed a staged Communist event, the so-called Kielce Pogrom certainly had the desired effect: \"So, emphasis in the United States press was placed on the anti-Semitism still existing in Poland, rather than on the significance of the rigging of the referendum (p. 249).\" In other words, the death of a few dozen Jews was deemed more newsworthy than the enslavement of 30 million Poles. What else is new? In addressing Jewish Communism (Zydokomuna) as a factor, Lane (p. 252) quoted some Jewish relief officials who opined that not more than 5% of the repatriated Polish Jews were Communistic in their viewpoint. If an accurate, then 5% of 250,000 returning Jews still meant that 12,500 of them were available to play an active part in the enslavement and exploitation of Poland. Had only one-quarter of these become U. B. (UB) members, and each one of these on average had tortured and murdered only 50 Poles, then over 30,000 Poles were the victims of Jewish murderers. Note that this number far exceeds the aggregate total of the much-ballyhooed actual or alleged Jewish victims of Poles (1930's \"pogroms\", Jedwabne and environs, Kielce Pogrom, postwar property-related killings, all combined). [More recent studies indicate that 37% of the leadership of the hated Bezpieka was Jewish, while only 1% of Poland's postwar population was Jewish.] Although this book does not directly discuss the postwar Polish-Jewish property disputes, a subject that has recently gotten a great deal of one-sided media attention because of the publication of the book FEAR by Jan T. Gross, it provides the context that destroys Gross' Pole-bashing thesis. To begin with, Ambassador Lane gives the reader a taste of the devastation of Poland by the Germans and Russians and the destitution of the Poles (partly quantified: p. 317). He even includes a surreptitious photo that shows a large Russian convoy taking away looted Polish property, and also informs the reader that the Red Army had seized 200,000 tons of grain from Polish lands. Furthermore, Lane points out (p. 219) that Poland was undergoing a serious shortage of grain that could lead to famine. Lane assesses the state of housing in postwar Poland, and how the Communists exploited it, as follows (p. 279): \"We received reports from the larger cities--Krakow, Poznan, Gdansk, Katowice, and Lublin--that those persons who refused to sign the manifesto were told that they would probably lose their living quarters and their jobs unless they reconsidered their attitude. The housing shortage was critical all over the country, especially in cities such as Warsaw and Gdansk, where the destruction made it almost impossible to find shelter.\" Well, duh! Might not a \"housing shortage...critical all over the country..\" suffice as an explanation for many Poles not being exactly thrilled when Jews came back to reclaim their property, and even killing them on very rare occasions (300-600 killings out of some 300,000 returning Jews)?</td><td>A 1944-1947 Polish History Book, Kielce Pogrom, Post-War Jewish-Polish Property Disputes</td><td>2010-12-27</td><td>986</td><td>2010</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>67000655</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2004-09-24</td><td>A133ZC2Z8MAIED</td><td>9997655990</td><td>Kevin M Quigg</td><td>The title says it all and De Jonge delves not only into the biography of his subject, but also the times that spawned this unique creature.

This book shows the truth behind so many of the Apple creations, that Jobs didn't make the windows interface and or even write so much of the code to his creations. He had vision and a flare for what people wanted and a temperamental approach that made it all come to be. Genius by Design exposed Jobs for the person he was, as fallible as any of us, a person one might even detest, and someone who left an indelible mark on our culture with his company's works. This is as fair-handed a review of a man's life as many biographies ever give. Highly recommended.</td><td>Jobs if fallible, this book is not.</td><td>2016-01-05</td><td>164</td><td>2016</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>67000663</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2016-04-25</td><td>A3SY3CRYOEMMZN</td><td>8186211926</td><td>Carla Araujo</td><td>Beautiful book.

Storyline details (as spoiler free as I can manage, anyway): Sarah Stanton, our intrepid heroine who we last saw running from the scene of a battle that claimed the \"life\" of Tom the automaton, has discovered that being a hero is a dash of excitement, and a lot of boredom as she scrapes out a living working in a department store, rather than crawling back to her father. She waits for the right chance to put Tom back together, holding onto both The Alpha Element she recieved from the late genius Sir Darby, and the heart of the automaton. Problem is, the Children of Eschaton also want this heart for their own sinister purposes. But she finds new friends to help her along the way to replace her fallen comrades from the first book. Regardless, it won't be easy... The author has a remarkable ability of really making the narrative and dialogue to really sound like a period piece. Of course, none of us reading this book can say for sure whether or not it's really accurate to the speech of the 1800s, but as an English major who's waded through many a piece of stuffy prose in my time, I can vouch that he mimics it very well, except for one small detail: it's fun. There are more superheroes, and supervillains with strange powers and gimmicks that hearken back to simpler ages of comic books, with a man dressed as Anubis and street thugs obsessed with using knives to the point of being comparable to Mr. Zsasz from Batman comics. And of course, no story like this is complete without a genocidal villain who is delightfully mad. There's little traces of subtlety to the writer's moral divisions in this book, but that can be forgiven, I think, given the style in which it's written. The back of the book's cover compares it to \"Gangs of New York if it were written by Jules Verne instead of Scorcese\", and I think that's a very crude, but accurate assessment of the writer's vision. It's one of the most engaging steampunk styled stories I've read, and I've gone through quite a few. That being said, this book isn't perfect. - One of my favorite parts of the original book was how it didn't get caught up too much of how clever some of the technology designs were. Unfortunately, due to the trappings of the plot of this middle book, there's no avoiding some of this technological exposition in this book. Just a pet peeve of mine, really. It's still not half as bad as some other books I've read in the same vein. - Being a middle book means it's hit or miss. Sure, middle parts of stories have given us stuff like \"The Empire Strikes Back\" before, but at other times we can be stuck with a story that just sort of arbitrarily ends. The climax is quite good, but the book basically ends at a spot that feels more like the end of a chapter rather than the end of a book. Just kind of abrupt. If you're reading just for the journey, though, moreso than the end, don't sweat this so much. All in all, a great sophomore effort, and I feel that Mayer is definitely one of the more underrated authors that deserves many many more readers. If you enjoyed the first book, you'll enjoy this one too.</td><td>A suitable sequel</td><td>2012-02-06</td><td>584</td><td>2012</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>67000668</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2016-12-02</td><td>A2L3D5IKMP1DQC</td><td>1942712820</td><td>Chris</td><td>Rollicking tale of two brothers, their weird and powerful family, and cool enemies all set in a Lovecraftian Universe.</td><td>Absolutely Splendid</td><td>2016-12-02</td><td>19</td><td>2016</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>67000669</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2017-02-02</td><td>A2APFLAVGB7D3M</td><td>B00N137K9M</td><td>Mavis</td><td>Oliver is deliciously wicked.

Hartley</td><td>I am torn over how to rate the novel, Annie Jordan by Mary Brinker Post but I finally gave it a 4, because I still like it. This was published by Doubleday in 1948. I have not read it since I was a young teenager. It has haunted me ever since, so I decided to get a copy and see why this book had stayed in my mind. Years and years have passed since I was a teenager. I became an English Literature graduate and then a Journalist and Editor. My reading and writing have been prolific. But when I retired, this book was still on my mind. Why? The setting is Seattle in the late 1800s when it was just getting established as a strong city on the West Coast. It is a romance novel about class: a son of a family on First Hill&# falls inlove with Annie Jordan, a girl of the docks. It is no different from other books on class differences written in the U.S., in that the class difference sets up all sorts of barriers in the hero's mind and leads to various results - none of them good for Annie - and yet - I still find it an excellent read, particularly about Seattle, the Yukon gold rush, and the establishment of shipping lines from Seattle. Was that the fascination and why I couldn't forget this book? After years of Journalism and analysis of books - I still don't know. It is a mystery to me why I remained attached to this book in my mind for so many years, particularly after all the deep reading I have done in great world literature. I must say that when reading it, I was very glad that life had taken me on a journey which led to far deeper reading. But that still does not explain why I still like it - although less than I did when I was thirteen. I do remember doubting at that age that class differences could override love. But it can and it does. That I know by now in further maturity. No longer could I cry over Annie's fate as I did at 13, because reality has shown me that class differences can very often overshadow the great force of love. The other fact about this novel is that I can find no information on Mary Brinker Post. Who was she? The internet seems to have no information whatsoever. In fact, I tried to get the book from the library in two different countries (Canada and the U.S.) and was told they never heard of it. So I took a chance on Amazon and there it was with one of the vendors. So it's still out there in some places. Summation: It is a good read, paricularly about Seattle and all the changes it was going through towards development at that time. I would call it a mere romance novel, if it weren't for the historical facts of Seattle settlement and development. But it is no Downton Abbey where the Earl's daughter marries the chauffeur. The class differences are real and destructive. All this is a preface to say that I had to give this four stars,because, after all this time I still like it. Could it be that, despite all the reality I have faced over all these years, I am still an incurable romantic?</td><td>Who is Mary Brinker Post?

It is an area that I have only dabbled in a few times, and something that I would like to know considerably more about. So when Packt Publishing contacted me and asked if I would like to review 3D Printing Blueprints by Joe Larson, my answer was kind of a no-brainer. I of course said yes. 3D Printing Blueprints is a series of projects or \"blueprints\" that show the reader how to model the projects effectively for 3D printing, with a focus on using home models of printers such as Makerbot. Commercial printers as discussed, but only briefly. Which is not a huge show stopper as a lot of what is shown and discussed does apply equally well to Commercial Printers as well. Biggest difference would be individual material specifications, which you should look up and check before sending off to a Commercial Printer anyhow. Layout of the book is divided into manageable sections which for the most part are clearly explained. There were a few areas where I had to read it a couple of times to understand what needed to be done next, but overall the instructions were understandable. While the projects were on the simple side, they did show a variety of techniques and types of things that could be done with a 3D printer. My favorite being the SD card holder ring and the teddy bear. The author, takes you step by step through the projects so that you should end up with the same model as described and have it be able to print properly. This book, while featuring Blender as the modeling software of choice, is not meant to be a full out guide to all things Blender. Tools and techniques are only covered as they are needed for the project at hand. Most users should be able to follow along fairly well. New users might have a few problems and should probably get somewhat familiar with Blender before attempting to use this book. If you are primarily interested in the 3D printing aspect of this book, it does do a pretty good job and should get you up and running with a minimum of fuss.</td><td>3D Printing using Blender</td><td>2013-10-08</td><td>391</td><td>2013</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>67000674</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>2017-04-20</td><td>AK0TLQ6BH5M72</td><td>B004XDC9G8</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Different, but enjoyable.

Very much a product of the mid-Meiji period, these masterfully-written little literary pieces are nonetheless timeless. Each piece is quite different from the rest, and yet almost all of them manage to start from everyday incidents or obvious observations and gradually spiral inwards to some deeply moving and startling insight into Japanese attitudes, values, and worldviews; more than once this seemingly methodless method allows Hearn to share with the reader certain common opinions and normal spiritual orientations held by average Japanese folks--the kinds of things usually taken for granted and so unarticulated, hence least amenable to documentation and scholarship (especially of the time, but even today). And Hearn does all this with an unpretentious erudition and an understated and balanced sympathy for his subject that, along with his literary flair for wonderfully clear and flowing prose, places his writings here in a category far above the rest. With him we can find none of the unintentional strains of condescension and orientalism so typical of folklore and religious anthropology, for while he's looking with the surprised gaze of the outsider with one eye, his other eye is that of the insider feeling very much at home where he is. The resulting view is visionary--but in subdued and shadowy tones. Appendix on an Appendix: in addition to the fifteen excellent essays forming the main body of \"Kokoro\", there's an extensive appendix featuring Hearn's translations of three popular folk ballads: \"The Ballad of Shuntoku-Maru\", \"The Ballad of Oguri Hangwan\" and \"The Ballad of O-Shichi, the Daughter of the Yaoya\". These are fascinating on a number of levels. They provide a tantalizingly fleeting glimpse of plebian drama, remarkable in its very lack of remarkableness. There's a certain sociological angle, as the versions of these oral ballads collected and translated by Hearn are those recited by mountain outcastes in the area of today's Shimane Prefecture. Religiously the first two ballads are key in understanding popular attitudes concerning pilgrimage in Japan--the first demonstrating a creepy (almost voodoo) edge in Kannon faith at Kiyomizudera Temple, the second delightfully exaggerating the rejuvenating benefits of Kumano and its sacred hot springs. Meanwhile, the third ballad is a straightforwardly melodramatic retelling of a true story better known to us today in a more refined and literary version as found in the novelist Saikaku's \"Five Women Who Loved Love\" of 1686.</td><td>A Fluent Translation of Unspoken Worldviews</td><td>2007-06-26</td><td>420</td><td>2007</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>67000688</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2015-09-11</td><td>AD7BII25MDOY8</td><td>B00HCU8R3I</td><td>Jamie</td><td>This memoir pulled me in and would not let me go.

My preference for reading materials generally does not include true crime type books, even though I am a former state fire, arson and explosion investigator and supervisor. A friend has been raving about the books written by retired Maine Game Warden John Ford, so I decided to say yes to the publicists invitation. I am so very glad I did say yes and read this book. This book is actually the seventh book in the Warden Force series. All 12 stories in this book are captivating and engaging. As I finished one story, I couldn't wait to begin reading the next. I am so glad to know that more stories await me in the other books. The About The Author page in the book states the author, Terry Hodges, has received national and state (California) writing awards. Having read this book, I can certainly understand why. He is definitely a gifted and talented writer and story teller. If you enjoy reading about the outdoors, wildlife or law enforcement, this book and probably the whole series should be at the top of your must read list. Well done Terry Hodges!

He wants to know more, so he picks up this book and reads it.  Our man from Tristan will be able to tell that Sidney Blumenthal likes and admires Bill Clinton a lot.  That's not a knock against Mr. Blumenthal in the least, as other authors have liked and admired their subjects, too - that's why they do a fine job of writing about them, their personal interest shows.  But in reading this book, the Tristan man will also learn that Mr. Clinton oversaw continuous economic expansion, more than 22 million jobs created, a home ownership rate increase from 64.0% to 67.5%, the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, higher incomes at all levels, the largest budget deficit in American history converted to the largest surplus of over $200 billion, the lowest government spending as a percentage of GDP since 1974, higher stock ownership by families than ever before, a 220% increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and a 300% increase in the Nasdaq from 1993 to 2001. Sounds like a heckuva job of improving America to me.  So why is Mr. Clinton one of those \"50%\" people, half love him and half hate him?  Mr. Blumenthal lays out a few reasons for the hate that still resounds today, and at base level it's all politics.  the hatred and vitrol directed at Mr. Clinton and family is absolutely, positively, moronically senseless.  We spent in excess of $70M trying to find something, anything, on a duly elected president, and it all ended up with an impeachment charge that seems as wispy as smoke today as it did in 1998.  And it was all over a private matter that, under normal circumstances, would be settled between a husband and wife.  The general mood of the country during the 1990s into the 2000s is as if we were one nation before Clinton took office; one group decided that we were two nations after he took office and open warfare on Clinton was continuous; and after he left office we should pretend we're one nation again.  The media has their fair share of blame in this sordid trashing of Clinton's presidency, too - our So-Called Liberal Media showed its colors brightly from 1992 to 2001.  I didn't agree with all of his policies and still don't, but personal attacks were never part of the disagreement.  But beyond the political reason, why do we trash this man who tried to do so much for this country?  Calling him names doesn't answer the question of why.  Skim away your prejudices, read the book and see if you think that we had some pretty darn good days under President Clinton. An argument brought up is that at 822 pages, this might have been a couple hundred pages too long.  There is a lot of personal information that Mr. Blumenthal includes about himself in here, like growing up and going to school.  At first glance, there is the thought that this information is superfluous; on the other hand, given his deep involvment with the subject and the President, The Clinton Wars were also The Blumenthal Wars, fought over the same fronts.

Too long to be a short story, too short to be a novel, they exist in this odd gray area between the two. Thats historically been a problem for marketers, of course, although thats lessened in the Kindle and e-book era. It remains a problem, though, for readers. What should you expect when you read a novella? Is it going to have some of the complexity of a novel  multiple plot threads, rich development  but simplified? Or is it going to be like a long short story, with a single thread, just extended? (For examples of each of these, you could probably use a few by Stephen King: Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption fits the former well, as does The Mist; meanwhile, The Sun Dog is a nice example of the latter.) The problem, such as it is, with The Man on the Bench is that I expected it to be the former, and it turned out to be the latter. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, mind you; theres something exciting about a nice, pulpy horror novel, and this one has a great hook, in which three boys growing up in a small town in the 1930s start seeing a man sitting on a bench, overlooking a local lakeand then they realize that no one else seems to see him. Thats a great eerie image to start off the story, and Swartwood takes in a fairly wild direction that I definitely didn't see coming. Whats frustrating, though, is that The Man on the Bench seems like its going to bemore. The book opens with some great scene-setting, and some wonderful material about a bully the boys have been dealing with, all of which makes for a great slice-of-life tale, or maybe some coming-of-age material. And as the horror elements started to creep in, I wondered if what I would get would be some great blending of those two aspects, something along the lines of It (albeit a far less ambitious version). Instead, about halfway through, Swartwood slams on the gas, and his story just moves like a rocket, as though he felt like he needed to get through the exposition and investigation in a hurry. The explanation for the man is conveyed in a pretty big chunk of exposition, and although the book then transitions to a pretty great, bizarre, surreal finale that I liked a lot, theres a sense that this middle section is cut down from something far more ambitious and interesting. Indeed, even Swartwoods touching ending feels like it belongs to a different version of this book than we got, something more about the end of childhood and the beginning of adulthood in the face of horrors. All of which sounds like Im being really negative about this book, and I don't really want to do that. Its a pretty solid read, and I was hooked pretty much throughout; although I found the exposition dump pretty disappointing, the beginning and end are both pretty fantastic. More than that, Swartwood makes his characters work well here, investing us in these people quickly and efficiently, and bringing this small town to life in a minimum of pages. (Given Swartwoods talent for what he calls hint fiction  stories of 25 words or less  that shouldnt be a surprise.) Its just that theres a sense that, outside of this pretty solid and fun novella, theres a much better novel version of it that I would have really loved to have seen. For what it is, though? Its pretty solid  creepy, engaging, well-written, well-crafted. I just wish it could decide what it wants to beor become something more.</td><td>It's engaging, creepy, effective..but it sometimes feels like we're reading an abridgement of something richer.</td><td>2016-04-26</td><td>618</td><td>2016</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>67000723</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2017-04-04</td><td>A75VY9Y2J5OIK</td><td>B01BMUY94Y</td><td>Robert in Yonkers NY</td><td>hold heave Jeans with no fatigue bending or damage .. very well made</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>2017-04-04</td><td>13</td><td>2017</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>67000724</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2016-06-22</td><td>A236DLI04C3PRZ</td><td>1534968466</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Great information simply stated.

At its heart is a being named Trusstrapped on Earth for a hundred years, Truss has no memory of his past, all thanks to his companion Ruth. Ruth is supposedly protecting Trusss memory and to return it to him when the proper time comes, but something along the way happens. Meeting the suicidal James, Ruth is compelled to give James Truss memories, leaving the human believing that hes supposed to play a role that has utter cosmic significance. Now theres the rubTruss needs to regain his memories, especially now that time is running out. Truss is essentially caught on the horns of a major dilemma: he no longer knows whom to trust, yet he must bite the bullet and somehow manages to convince James and his other human friend to go to what they call the Molgathras Archetype so that he could get his memories back. But as you can guess, things don't happen as planned, as powerful forces move in to conspire over who takes control of the planet. Author Lucas Kitchen chooses slow burn over flashy actionWorld Builder builds up slow, but the strategy works to only make the climax much more satisfying. And did I mention this is an epic tale that could leave your blood curdling in excitement? I also love how Truss loves learning about everythingessentially a tabula rasa, he reminds me of that other character on Vanna Bontas novel, Flight. Overall, I highly recommend World Builder to science fiction fans who want something more from their booksa deeper sense of emotional gravitas, great writing, interesting and believable characters, and a plot thats refreshingly original.

I read all three books in this series in less than a week.  This review is similar to the one I wrote for the second book. I urge you to read the series in order, starting with The Cartel. Lilian, the heroine of this series, is a woman of agency  she acts to make things happen. Because of the crimes of her father, she is stripped of all her possessions, her honor and title, and is sentenced to a three year trial by ordeal in lieu of death. Her neighbors, her co-workers revile her, both for what is popularly viewed as cowardice for not committing suicide, and due to the publicity of this father's crime. (Think O.J. Simpson.)  Lilian has very little control over anything in her life: She cannot be in a room with a man without a chaperone, even a former teacher, she cannot refuse to tell her master anything he wishes to know, she cannot complain, she cannot ask for instructions, she cannot refuse her master any sort of sexual service.  Every hour of her time must be accounted for; should she be late she may be disciplined. However, in order to survive the ordeals, she must use her brain (action), which is quite extraordinary.  She must find ways to get her masters will done without violating the rules (action).  And, when her masters enemies attack her, she must defendant herself with wits, avoidance or a six-inch knife action.

In this, the second of his stories I have read, the author has found a new voice and (IMO) a new level of skill.  \"In Extremis\", the first McKinney book I read, was a great stand-alone novella. The detail was fantastic without being wordy, the characters were easy to understand without going very deep, and the story itself was quite creative - not easy in this day and age when we think we've seen all there is to see regarding zombie horror.  He's already proven he can capture our attention with a single page, that he knows how to be concise, and that he knows how to balance sentimentality with horror. Now he's shown that he also understands that most basic concept so many new authors don't grasp - human nature.  In \"Feed\", McKinney exposes an entirely new side of himself. We're more focused on the protagonist, digging much deeper into who he is than we did with the nun. The author is more open with emotion and vulnerability, providing a character we can all identify with on some level as opposed to a generic \"good\" person. Who among us has never felt lonely, out of place, or uncomfortable in our own skin?  Even the secondary characters were spot on. A struggling mother who loses control for just a moment. A macho man of mystery. A manipulative seductress with evil intentions. All are colorful and contribute to the story; none feel out of place.  I'm very impressed with what I've seen from McKinney, and the few faults I might otherwise mention are so insignificant when compared to the whole that they become irrelevant.

The first disappointment was the mere 127 pages of text and the cheesy cartoon duck graphics that looked like they were cut out of a third grader's clipart book. Second, the first 28 pages were nothing but puffery about the author's background.  You felt like they were trying to create credibility by telling you how great they were. Third, they belabor a point or concept over and over again... especially when you get it the second time. And finally, I have to assume that this book is targeted at Screenwriters, and therefore the audience has a decent grasp on structure and concept.  Much of the content comes across as either condescending, plodding and very simplistic.  I found nothing in this thin book that revealed any insight or method that would equip me to adapt a screenplay.

Manning's cathartic rendition of Vin in this book topples into self-sabotage, self-doubt, self-denegration, and self-remorse by painting Vin as the Rat King, or even worseRance's belittling nickname of \"Little King.\" Vin could never move others into dynamic self-empowerment via his ritualistic initiations unless he himself were aware of his own magical abilities in toto. \"Something greater does not come from something lesser.\" Which leads me to believe that Mr. Manning may be tweaking my nose with his unabashed cleverness.

The author paints a very dreadful picture regarding what will happen to society when food runs scarce. We take for granted that there is a balance and the real trouble occurs when that balance remains no more. They story is about Ben Donnelly and his family as they try to survive the crash of society. I remembered works like The Walking Dead and even Mad Max as I read the story. The Donnelly's encounter several people on their journey and some of the people they meed aren't good. Society of Supper has a lot of thrills and you will remain unsure about the people you can trust in they story. The desperation of the Donnelly family is evident and feels realistic.

The male lead is a former sex addict who now only lets his need surface away from home, in controlled bursts.  And he wants to break through her addiction by not having sex with her by making her want something more.  While the psychology of this approach just feels wrong, I could still able to immerse myself into the book. Once they build up to finally getting busy, he suffers a spinal injury that currently has him not able to feel or move his legs.  Because he punctured a lung in the same accident, the doctors are too concerned to try to fix the spinal injury.  But they let him go back to his hotel so he will be more comfortable, and then they wait more than a month to try to fix his paralysis.  This is where the author completely blew up my immersion into the story, as none of the medical aspects made sense to anyone that a modest understanding of these types of injuries.

A vampire, a werewolf, an immortal and a shapeshifter? Who would not raise a brow at that cast of characters? S.C. Wright captured my interest from the very first chapter. We meet Kana and her son Michael, on a train headed into the unknown. She is having a rough time managing her son until she notices a gentleman in the car with her. After introducing herself to him (Theodore Schmidt ), the tale truly begins. The circumstances for Kana being on this particular train is interesting, and that is what greets us in the first chapter. She begins telling Theodore (in exchange for something she wants) about why she was traveling alone in such a foreign place with a toddler. As is mentioned in the blurb, Kana is miserable at home. She feels unloved and unappreciated by her mother and sister. This goes to the extreme, but makes you understand more of Kanas reactions to certain situations. An unfortunate accident on her 19th birthday sets a world-wind of events into motion. Being kidnapped by a vampire and an immortal is only the beginning. Meeting the werewolf and similarly fascinating characters propels this book forward. Each has their own backstory, and we learn more of why they respond to Kana in different ways. It is difficult to write this review without giving away any of the most intricate details. Suffice it to say, Kana ends up in a situation that she could have never dreamed with a group of people only thought of as imaginary. Parts of the story are a bit jumpy as well as some of the slang, but I enjoyed the read. Bad Reception is a captivating tale for young adult readers and one they would enjoy. I found myself laughing aloud in a few areas and saddened in others. The cast of characters is not vast and they are well developed. However, I would have liked a more in depth explanation or showing of the unique abilities of certain characters. That would have definitely made the story more enthralling. I would recommend this book for YA readers. There is a bit of a language, but it is not overly used. The book needs a bit of editing, but that did nothing to take away from my experience.

Starting from the great cover shot and continuing through almost every page inside, this collection shows off perfect shots one right after another like a machine gun. This work is clearly heavily fashion influenced and is very contemporary: this work is typical in the sense that you can see pictures like these in many top-end fashion rags, but here you have the added bonus of nudity. That typicalness is the one short coming in this collection, but there are indications that this guy is making his own mark on the subject and if that aspect grows he could be the next Andreas Bitesnich. This is an excellent book, extremely well laid-out, the quality of the paper and the printing are excellent, the size is big and bold (nice!), and the book feels like quality. I'd have liked to see more pages. But 140 isn't too bad. So great photography, great production quality, and let's mention the subjects. His choices in models are excellent. All these beautiful, youthful fashion girls with waif-like bodies. Very nice. So why the 4 Stars and not 5? As I mentioned the work is typical of it's genre. There are a lot of photographers whose work is also excellent and also looks a lot like this. That said, Poinsard clearly has >>something<< that is \"him\" and I'd like to see him define that further in his next book. Also the price could be a bit lower considering there are just 140 pages in this book. Not highly overpriced, but a bit too expensive for this size. Those two factors are enough to take away one star. But this is still a great book and well worth having. You won't regret this purchase if you like trendy-sexy-cool photography of beautiful girls.

The method which is amply illustrated in this work is through the technique of guided visual imagery. Over forty exercises are provided in the text aimed at enabling each of the readers to come to term with the self they want to be. Besserman , a psychoanalytic therapist with a Ph.

However, this one was more comedic than The Gap Year, and it just didn't click for me. I felt the characters were more one-dimensional, each designed to play a part in a morality tale, rather than feeling true to life. The lead character Blythe Young is former 'trailer trash' (character's words, not mine) who has worked her way up to the heights of 'Old Austin' society through marriage and a catering business. However, she's now divorced, and because of a series of deceptions she tried to pull off, shunned by her high society friends. She ends up bunking with her old college friend Millie, who is now a spiritual counselor of sorts. Over time, Blythe is forced to own up to her deceptions and make good, and she (and her society friends) come to realize the folly of their ways and develop more meaningful lives. I like that premise, but unfortunately, the sitcommish set of events that leads up to their transformation is just too wacky and out there for me, and I didn't develop enough of a relationship with the characters (including Blythe) to appreciate their transformation. So while I appreciate the overall spiritual message and did enjoy some of the comedy, overall this was just so-so for me. Based on The Gap Year though, I will give a couple more of Sarah Bird's books a try.</td><td>Didn't Love This One - Too Sitcommish</td><td>2012-05-25</td><td>252</td><td>2012</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>67000780</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2016-08-22</td><td>A1Y9CKZKHQACUF</td><td>984838368</td><td>Molly</td><td>A must read for anyone who wants to remain or become as healthy as possible.</td><td>Important information not found in main stream.</td><td>2016-08-22</td><td>15</td><td>2016</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>67000781</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2017-11-18</td><td>AWG41315YSXQM</td><td>B00YTNMHEQ</td><td>Christine Frances</td><td>This book was exciting, to say the least.

Essentially it is a guide to right- eating with a bit of exercise- help thrown in. It has lists and appendices which are useful, including one on the super- foods and essential vitamins. There is no information here which is so far as I can tell earth- shakingly new. Dr. Weil and a host of others will tell you pretty much the same thing. There is the usual promotion of Omega - 3 Reservaotol , of controlling inflammation, and de- toxifying the body. There is the stress on the importance of exercise. For myself I learned that I should eat a number of foods I have to this point resisted: almonds, avocado, blueberries, pumpkin ( I don't think I'll make this one) wild salmon. I too picked up a couple of useful exercises. Basically I believe the book is sound. I wish however it had had a chapter on the worst foods, on foods which should be avoided at all costs. Sugar, white- bread , trans- fat stuff, fatty red meat, etc. If there are lists for the good stuff, why not lists for the bad? The book is clearly and simply written. It does not excite or provide humor but I believe it is very good and can be very helpful.

Staples</td><td>\"Tanganyikan Guerrilla; East African Campaign 1914-18\" by Major J.R. Sibley,BAOR, is an exploration of the Allied campaign against German East Africa in World War I.  During this campaign, a huge Allied force of British, South African (a British colony at the time), and King's African Rifles (native) chased a tiny German force (10% German, 90% African) all over British East Africa, German East Africa, Portuguese East Africa, and Northern Rhodesia (also a British colony).  The German force, commanded by General Paul von Lettow Vorbeck, was still undefeated when they learned of the Axis surrender two days after 11 November 1918.  Marching in to surrender their arms to the Alles, they were accorded the full honors of war (the Germans were allowed to keep their arms and the Africans -- both askaris and camp follwers -- were repatriated to their homes).  On 2 March 1919, von Lettow Vorbeck and his 155 Germans marched through Berlin under arms. \"Tanganyikan Guerrilla; East Africa Campaign 1914-18\" is part of a British series of history books sold in the U.S. from the late 60s to the early 80s.  The genius of this was that the books were well written, relatively inexpensive, and were sold in drug stores everywhere.  Normally, three or four new titles were released every few weeks.  I was lucky in that my mom would pony up the $2 each week so I could buy one.  This was about the same as $10 today.  The Series started out as \"Ballantines Illustrated History of World War II,\" but turned into the \"Ballantine Illustrated History of the Violent Century\" when they branched out to World War I, conflicts between the World Wars, and the Arab-Isaeli Wars.  Interstingly, a young John Keegan appears as a consultant editor.  Happily, Amazon.com appears to offer almost all of the titles through their used book dealers.</td><td>Victory in German East Africa</td><td>2008-11-20</td><td>317</td><td>2008</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>67000798</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2015-10-09</td><td>AL6H88JHUMKC2</td><td>1935191241</td><td>Carol A.</td><td>No issues</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>2015-10-09</td><td>2</td><td>2015</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>67000799</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2015-02-05</td><td>A39HIWURDW72ZJ</td><td>B00NEVHVWC</td><td>Thomas A.</td><td>Having recently just read and loved, Paul Kyriazi's book, \"Rock star Rising.\" Naturally, I couldn't wait to read his newest novel, \"The Mexican Swimmer.\"  And once again, I was not disappointed in the least. Paul's ability to tell a really great story comes through in such a natural way, you feel like you're reading a movie, and as you read your mind becomes the silver screen. The Mexican Swimmer tells the tale of an anti-hero, named, Rodrigo Villalobos. One evening standing on a balcony he can see across the village, seven brothels between him and his home. Bragging to his bodyguards, that he will swim his way home, thus proving to them and himself, he's still the virile, macho specimen, women long for. His impetuous endeavor however, places not only Rodrigo into a life and death struggle but also has put his family in the crosshairs of death. A stunning, fast-paced thrill ride of a story. Paul's deep affection for pure cinema comes through page after page in The Mexican Swimmer. I liken his writing style to joy of watching classic film by the greatest of film directors.

People have such different pictures of Jesus. There is the bearded lady Jesus from Sunday School halls. Some movies present a vacant-eyed weirdo Jesus, unflappable and deadly serious. Twentieth-century activists portray a revolutionary type. Some postmodern artists have portrayed a more human Christ, to the angst of many churchgoers. Michael Frost offers a fresh read of Luke to reframe Jesus, or more accurately shows how Jesus reframes our views - of our sin, our guilt, our relating to other people and our relationship to God. This reframing comes from seeing and understanding Jesus as a fool, not as unintelligent but like the medieval court jester who mischievously and provocatively undermines pretension and challenges the status quo. When Jesus came on the Palestinian scene, people longed for a messiah in the image of Judas Maccabeus the underdog revolutionary, or perhaps another John the Baptist ascetic type. Instead Jesus came quietly from Nazareth on the margins of Palestine and shattered people's expectations with his refusal to take up arms and his eagerness to attend parties. For his first miracle, he used ceremonial jars to lubricate an almost dry wedding. Many of his encounters with people were over food and drink in the midst of their culture. He was labelled a glutton and a drunkard and criticised for who he ate with. And he asked his disciples to remember him and to embody his life - by eating and drinking! His approach was so different to the expectations of the existing religious and political systems, but he was bringing new life and hope to both. Jesus embodied an abundant, hope-full and hope-giving life. Luke shows how Jesus encountered people and gave them fresh perspectives. Through conversation and parable, he reframed how people can experience what really is good news: - forgiveness as gift rather than reward - community that values relationships over property - generosity in a world that is stingy - hospitality in a world of hostility. Frost paints an inviting yet radical picture. He digs into the cultural background of Luke (drawing especially on Kenneth Bailey), tells inspiring stories and challenges the reader to join Jesus on the road and help others to reframe their views of church and Jesus. Jesus was out-of-the-box outrageous character, seemingly foolish at times and certainly a `fool' in the medieval sense of questioning the status quo. Ash Barker comments, `This Jesus is one who may be out of place in boring and predictable churches, but is alive to the margins and true to the Gospels.' This is a helpful book to read alongside Luke and provides a wealth of background material and stories for preachers, small group leaders and personal reading. But it comes with a warning - it may radically reframe your view of Jesus and how he calls us to relate to the world.

Let me start out by saying that after reading the description, I was completely ready to jump right in. A magical typewriter that writes back to you with secrets that have to do with a family curse. Sign me up! Except that I couldn't get past the first four chapters to find out more. This book deserved another draft. It's a brilliant concept that just isn't hitting the mark. Elizabeth is going on sixteen years old and she acts like she's a child. The characterization is off there, she just doesn't pull me in and make me fantasize about being that age again with the adventures I could have had. This really needed a tighter edit and a better proofread before being published. Some of the word choices don't seem appropriate for the action or dialogue they're being used with. For example, when Jack, the grandpa, finally comes home to visit after not seeing the family for eight years, he wants to talk about what her and her mom have been up to first. \"'Same old, same old. School, soccer practice, school, repeat,' I replied, brushing my hand against my forehead and swooning over the table.\" Why is she swooning? And why would she think he would know what the \"same old, same old\" is when he's been absent for eight years? I think that line in particular is what pulled me out of the story. He may have been sending postcards for all those years, but that's not the same as actually being there or holding conversations over the phone-something they apparently hadn't done over the years. The third chapter about the boxes Jack brought home as gifts really needed to be edited. In one spot, the mom was clenching her teeth, but the word used was \"clinching.\" Aside from an error like that and with missing commas, the real issue lies with the content. Elizabeth was supposed to open a certain box, but then she wanted Jack to open it, but then he told her to open it. Then she felt weird about opening it. It just kept going with her not opening the box. I understand that this was to create suspense surrounding what was in the box, but all it did was make me want to slap Elizabeth for taking her sweet time. It's like being at a birthday party where you want to see the birthday girl open a particular gift, and then she decides to unwrap it in slow motion. You're not being suspenseful, you're being annoying. There's also the issue of the dialogue feeling forced along with telling readers what's happening as opposed to showing. I think this is really where Danielle could have improved. In the beginning, Elizabeth is talking with her mom about Jack coming to visit. Her mom asks her to grab the crackers, and then Elizabeth responds with \"Here's the crackers.\" There was never any action involved. It would have been better to show us grabbing the crackers and just handing them to her mom instead of telling us about it. Also, there is nothing wrong with using \"said\" for the dialogue tag, but other words are used in its place which aren't realistic. In regard to the surprise her mom and Jack had for Elizabeth and telling her about it, this was the mom's response: \"'If you must,' Mom whined.\" Why would she be whining? She's just as excited about the trip that she worked so hard to conceal. In closing, I was totally hooked on the idea of the story, but the execution needed help. I really think another draft and a better editor would have made this story wonderful.

Like Pride and Prejudice's Darcy and Elizabeth or You've Got Mail's Joe and Kathleen, Adam and Valerie feel attraction to each other, but that won't get in the way of their fighting at every turn. And Valerie does not have a thing for Cowboys (certainly not!), even if she can't stop from trembling every time she gets close enough to smell Adam or admire his muscles. Another unexpected treat: Rena's research in firefighters is evident, and the novel  delivers a sense of what it's like to live together on shifts and work together in dangerous situations. So what are the Benefits of reading Love's Secret Fire? Real-life Romance: While novels frequently create tension and roadblocks for characters-and this novel does, too, with criminals and investigations and undercover work that makes what could have been a smooth courtship into an unavoidable tangle-Koontz does something that I love and which so few romances do... She shows the way that real romance can be unglamorous, very everyday, and still sweet. In one scene, after Valerie has had about a dozen too many because of a personal tragedy, Adam has to care for her in the bathroom, on cold tile, while she gets sick, snores, and drools on his T-shirt. While this doesn't sound much like a typical romance novel, it sounds a lot like romance to me--at least of the lasting kind. What's sexier than a couple who cares for each other for better and for worse? So when Valerie wakes up and puts on his over-sized button-up shirt, its sexy and sweet and not just another badly used cliche.

Saru blames herself for the destruction at the end of the first book. The deaths of innocents are really weighing heavily on her conscience. At first she completely forgets the implication of ridding herself of the implant. Ripping herself free from the general consensus and mass thought or action being regurgitated by those around her. Her actions also inadvertently influence those around her. In this case John the Gaesporan, another one set on discovering his individuality and separating himself from the hive. Not sure Saru realises how much more damage her single-handed rebellion will cause to those who are aware of their surroundings and themselves, and those who aren't aware at all. Saru was missing her spunk and quest for answers in this book. She spent a lot of time wandering aimlessly through the confines of abstract fantasy worlds, with the sole purpose of those worlds being mass fornication.

Being a huge fan of any murder mysteries, this book has erotic avenues that keep the reader wanting more to the story.  If you like suspense then the main character Jack will draw you from the beginning.  Murder mystery, erotica, suspense are the three words that will make you want to buy this series.  I can see this book become a famous movie one day.  The main character goes on a mission in Denmark and his eyes are drawn to Katarina.  What came to mind is the titanic love story, and is Katarina trustworthy or not? Here are my notes from this awesome book: Sergei Mikhailova faded into the shadows of the dockside building and lit a cigarette as he waited for the courier with the critical package.  He flipped closed the Zippo lighter he stole from an American tourist.  He loved his shots of vodka, otherwise he did not know how he'd cope with his demanding job of his. It was dead silent except for the ship blowing its fog horn in the distance,  it was bitterly cold, the smell of dead fish...as he waited and smoked, he  noticed a huge piles of dirty snow up and down the dock, Sergei checked his watch it was 12:10 the courier was late or not coming? The item he waited for paved the way for Alexi Chenikova's master plan and Sergei knew the man trusted no one else to ensure its safe delivery to their office in St. Petersburg. Finally the white compact car he was told to expect approached. He thought to himself, what on earth is this idiot doing? Sergei watched his every move, mad as hell. Finally the designated drop-off point, 20 minutes late was not acceptable for Sergei.  He stepped I to the light to reveal his presence, waiting for the man to emerge from the car.  The courier was told to go to him, per instructed. He made eye contact and brought the package over. Sergei asked \"what took you so long\" sorry had trouble find the place, Sergei took package and slipped it into his empty attach case, on a crate net to him. The courier asked where my payment is. Payment- Sergei laughs and says, here it is.  He pulled the knife from his belt and let fury drive him. He slashed the man's carotid artery before the man knew what was coming. Sergi put the dead courier in the driver's seat belted him in and turned the key to start the ignition and rolled down the window before closing the door.  He reached inside sifted the car into gear and used the steering wheel to direct it off the side of the dock.  He competed the most important step towards Alexi's glorious new era. Jack Lazar sat up on the side of his plush bed and rubbed his hands over his face from the night before while he drank with his friend Terrance. Home in San Juan Capistrano sat on top of a hill, its contemporary styling often reminding people of a Guggeheim museum. It was 7:45 am, Jack went down the winding stairs, and to find Terrance making coffee in the kitchen...Jack was his friend and attorney, mentioned over coffee that \"you should expect a call from Harry Benson today.\" Benson was the senior partner at Benson Kohler and one of Jack's closet friends, if not a second father to him.  Jackie left the firm earlier in the year amidst the most bizarre set of events, Harry had offered for Jack to return to the company, and he pondered on it every day. He missed the game, Jack's former relationship with Lisa is what he missed, Harry's daughter that made him hesitate to accept the offer. The firm needed Jacks help with a transaction in Denmark, and our senior partner wants me to join you over there. \"I find it interesting that you and everyone else have apparently assumed I'm going to take the assignment.\"  The phone rings, Jack? Its Harry....Harry wants Jack to go back to work at the firm. The client is TILLMAN PHARMACCEUTICALS, They want to buy a publicly traded medical device company out of Copenhagen, and Bert Tillman asked for you. The company is called ZT MedTech they developed the greatest version of what's called an S-ICD or let me be sure I get this right, a subcutaneous implantable carioverter defibrilator.\" It's like a pacemaker with automatic defibrillator placed into someone's chest. It doesn't use wires, gets implanted between the patients skin and rib cage.  It monitors a person's heart 24/7 and gives electrical charges as needed to regulate it or defibrillate it, but the device also keeps track of other vital signs, which are transmitted to the patient's doctor at regular intervals via cellular technology. Scotland, Annabel and Mark together in a restaurant when the device is inside their son and the son died of a heart attack right in front of them. Their son Died. Jack Lazar meets woman whom after a night of romance stole his briefcase which has to do with the ZT deal. Secret agent fighting against those who would kill or take advantage of others to further agendas fueled by greed, power or twisted obsessions.  There are many sexy women after another each of whom makes his missions that much more difficult and dangerous.

The first 65 pages are devoted to the necessary groundwork for studying Chinese. Introduction [pp. 1-7], \"Why Another beginning Chinese Textbook?\" explains that this book is designed to help people who are probably NOT in a formal classroom setting, but do need to get around in a (Mainland) Chinese environment. \"An important part of Chinese study in such situations is learning how to work with tutors who know Chinese but don't know how to teach it. In other words, learners need to learn how to gently turn well-meaning native speakers of Chinese into effective language teachers.\" The next section, \"Studying Chinese With This Book,\" [pp. 8-29] presents three strategies: [Plan A: The First-Month-In-China Spoken Chinese Plan], [Plan B: The Speaking and Survival Reading Plan], [Plan C: The Total Mastery Plan]. Learners are responsible for deciding how and what they want to learn, instead of relying on what Mr. Snow diplomatically refers to as \"well-meaning native speakers'\" decisions about what a foreigner should be learning. This entails gauging one's energy levels and available time as well as deciding on a preferred study style. The author gives many intelligent suggestions, such as forming a support group of like-minded people and avoiding lazy (of course, Mr. Snow is too polite to say it directly) foreigners who claim Chinese is just too difficult. The third section, \"Working With Tutors,\" has many astute observations, such as why professional teachers usually don't make ideal tutors and how (and why!) to pay tutors without causing offense. The fourth and largest introductory section covers pronunciation and the greatest stumbling stone for most foreign learners, the four tones. This is one place where I would disagree with Mr. Snow. His basic advice is sound (keep listening and practice a lot), but his description of tone is phonetically naive. Snow  uses a 6-pitch scale (0-5) rather than the 5-pitch scale (1-5) used by modern linguists for the past 90 years or so.  Snow is quite systematic about marking neutral tone (which he renames \"light\" tone), but inexplicably marks the general measure word \"ge\" as \"ge4\" throughout the text. Snow mentions tone sandhi (without using the technical word)  involving two third-tone syllables, but ignores tone sandhi involving 1, 7, and 8 (which many Chinese also ignore, so at least he's consistent). Since this is a textbook for general readers who just want to get their feet wet, these problems are rather trivial. The main body of this book is divided into 24 lessons. One of the things I admire the most is that this textbook is peppered with many practical suggestions on how to get out into the street and practice with real people, along with the occasional pep talk for those whose progress seems too slow. A few samples: Lesson 8: Getting Things Fixed \"Point to equipment and appliances that might break or have already cause problems and ask your tutor to say the names of the objects in Chinese as you write them down in Pinyin. Keep a notebook.\" Tip: Accents and dialects \"There are only a few places in China where the average person actually pronounces things the way textbooks say they should. ...accept this as a reality rather than burning a lot of emotional energy getting frustrated by it. Perhaps even revel in it as a reflection of China's rich regional diversity.\" The last two sections are a Chinese to English glossary (pp. 307-327) and a list of other Chinese books to continue one's study and three guides to language learning. Survival Chinese would be useful even for people who plan to live in Taiwan, because a tutor can readily point out the few places where \"We usually don't say it that way.\" Most of the simplified characters can be readily recognized by Taiwanese -- they will supply the traditional forms used here.

Ms Manning did a good job of making us see both of their sides in the main argument, though I had a tendency to side more on Callum's side their eventual resolution was a good one and led to a sweet ending.

Little Elk may have been present at the murder of her family and capture of Grace, but he was not the one responsible. When she is placed with him, at first he treats her as a captive but over time it changes, eventually turning to love. When Fawn is captured by soldiers and taken to Fort Sully, what will become of a white woman, carrying an Indian baby? How can she escape and get back to her Lakota tribe and family? The story paints a picture of the life, struggles, and greed of white men as they chase after dreams caused by Gold Fever. The lives of the Lakota Indians, who just want to live on their homeland, hunt buffalo and live in peace.  But white mens greed and lack of respect for what belongs to the People brings about war, death and a constant battle of wills. The plot kept me captivated and the story is so well told with the history and description of scenery that as a reader you can envision the sights and smells around you. The dialog and emotions are open, honest and heartwarming. The sentiments and animosity of how the whites feel towards Indians and Indians towards white are well described.

It reads fine however, perhaps with some different editing, she could bridge the gap into making this book more relevant to a wider audience than just friends and family.</td><td>Priced high considering what you get</td><td>2014-01-19</td><td>108</td><td>2014</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>67000863</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2016-01-26</td><td>A246ZWN45R5GMK</td><td>B016RB2XBY</td><td>Murphy&#039;s Law 75</td><td>Keeps you warm and toasty on cold winter nights</td><td>Nice and warm</td><td>2016-01-26</td><td>9</td><td>2016</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>67000864</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2015-01-05</td><td>A30W8QG0ADTDD</td><td>1460252985</td><td>RmD</td><td>Imagine being suddenly thrown back into time at random moments and random intervals without any warning or explanation.

Vizcarra</td><td>I haven't read a lot of zombie books, but the ones that I have read all seem to take place in a world in which the zombie apocalypse has already taken place. The Finster effect was a refreshing change of pace for me. It focuses on the very early stages of a zombie outbreak, and provides a dastardly explanation of just how corporate greed and incompetence could lead to this kind of disaster. The source of the zombie outbreak could just as easily be believed to be the same cause as the kind of gross negligence that rocketed Erin Brockovich to the public consciousness. The story starts out innocuously enough, and with a simply brilliant way of introducing the main characters for the tale. A preacher inveighs a fast food worker, who goes home and catches a cab from her house to her father's house, where she finds her father and stepmother dead in the bedroom. The cabbie that took her there heads back to his own property, where he meets an insurance man who needs to look at one of the structures on the property, conveniently next to a bear preserve guarded by a dog. The dog watches his master and mistress die, and not understanding, tries to defend their young boy when people come to clean up. This strange path of introduction is not unlike a single continuous take from a film, like the opening to The Player, and serves as an extremely clever introduction to important players in the story. Each chapter is told from the perspective of one of these characters, so the opening introductions are cleverly connected one after the other. Once the key players are introduced, the story rotates through the perspectives of people we already know, with an occasional new character's perspective thrown in as needed. In addition to the separate character perspectives, we are also provided with perspective of certain animals. Dogs, cats and rats all have their own voice in this story. It's quite amusing to see the intelligence hierarchy of these three animals, evident in the way their narratives read. It is especially amusing to read the capricious cat thoughts given voice. We even get to briefly see the perspective of zombies themselves. Friday sprinkles key clues casually throughout the story, subtly informing the reader with key pieces of information so that we can start to weave the various characters and their histories together into a cohesive plot. As I mentioned, this is not a post-apocalyptic world. This is a normal town, which also unfortunately contains sociopaths, murderers, misfits and freaks. Not everyone in this story is a survivor in the traditional zombie story sense. There are people who just want to get back to their dysfunctional lives - because and in spite of the rapid decline of everything around them. I enjoyed the beginning of this book a bit more than the ending. I'm not sure I understood everything that was happening at the end of the book, but there are some very thought-provoking bits regarding how individual survivors, cut off from communication, fret and wonder just how bad things are outside their hot zone. The Finster Effect is a wonderfully entertaining story of damage control, isolation, desperation and a fairly unique interpretation of how a simple mistake can escalate beyond any company's ability to control the situation. It's an outrageous collision of worst-case scenarios, sprinkled with sad moments of discovery, futility and revelation.</td><td>Not everyone deserves to survive the zombie apocolypse</td><td>2013-02-04</td><td>575</td><td>2013</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>67000867</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>2011-09-26</td><td>A12OYN0X2GDUB</td><td>B0058PRP6Y</td><td>sinnerarity</td><td>An interesting review of a small book binding business.

The theme song from the hit television show Cheers said, \"Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got.\" Sometimes that is absolutely true. Although life is often filled with the ordinary, punctuated by moments of drama or stress (or both), simply making it through the every day struggles we face can be difficult and require more strength and fortitude than we can imagine. Ethan Hauser's novel The Measures Between Us is a beautifully written book about people making it through the struggles of everyday life, and coping with the bumps and bruises along the way. Vincent, a high school shop teacher, and his wife, Mary, are contemplating sending their troubled daughter, Cynthia, to a mental hospital because they fear she might harm herself. Vincent seeks the counsel of a former student, Henry, who is now a psychologist. Meanwhile, Cynthia, both before and after her time in the hospital, has an on-again, off-again relationship with Jack, an intern on a project that tries to understand climate change, particularly flooding, and how it affects those who choose to stay in their homes during floods. Henry's life is not without its own problems. He and his wife, Lucinda, are expecting a baby, and although their relationship appears to be strong, both are struggling--Henry with fidelity, and Lucinda with feelings of dread about her pregnancy and her life with Henry, because she isn't sure if she can handle how much he loves her. I was completely captivated by Hauser's writing and the way he spun each of his characters' stories, but ultimately, I found this book not entirely satisfying. Other characters in the book are brought into the plot and appear at its periphery, but you're never quite sure why. The book spends some time recounting Henry's interviews with people who lived through significant floods, but you're never quite sure where these stories connect to the plot (except for one incident that seems to be a catalyst for an encounter that never goes anywhere). And I found the ending of the book completely jarring, as something occurs but is only mentioned, and I felt totally robbed by it given my investment in the plot and the characters. Interestingly enough, the description of The Measures Between Us talks about an unprecedented storm threatening the East Coast, but that is really a minor plot point that goes nowhere. This is a book more about the storms of everyday life and how we choose to weather them (or avoid them). And, like life, our success rate is mixed--sometimes the storms pass and sometimes the storms hit us. I just wish the book was as fully engaging as Hauser's writing is.</td><td>A book about the storms of life, and how we weather (or avoid) them...</td><td>2013-07-12</td><td>453</td><td>2013</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>67000869</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>2014-09-14</td><td>A344I9YN6XD81G</td><td>1574441019</td><td>Utkan Uluay</td><td>Every improvement is a change.

However,  scratch the surface and the truth bleeds through. Tired of not being respected by his kids, fed up with his controlling wife, set up for a fall by his work - his thoughts become dominated by a desire to kill. Anyone. What makes SALARYMAN UNBOUND work so well is Shiro's inability to follow through despite his best intentions. Throughout the novel opportunities present yet there is always something getting in the way, prohibiting that ultimate act of violence.

In order to consolidate support, he creates a \"terrorist\" attack in a night club and places the blame on a muslim extremist. The only problem is, most of the killing was done by government agents and they left a few witnesses alive who could tell the story.

Egolf</td><td>Joseph Harrington's YANKEE SAMUARI is an important book that has been neglected.  Yet, this book is a necessary tribute to Americans of Japanese Ancestry (AJAs)who served in the U.S. military during World War II.  These men served in combat in North Africa, Europe, and the South Pacific.  Mr. Harrington's book is an antidote to those who refuse to recognize such valor or too cowardly to report it. Harrington makes clear that when World War II erupted, the American military authorities lacked intelligence officers who could translate Japanese intercepts.  Their desparation was so great that U.S. milirary officials had to enter American concentration camps where AJAs were confined due to Pres. Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066 which ordered all U.S. citizens to these camps for no reason whatsoever.  Even the FBI Director, J. Edgar Hooever, was clear that AJAs were not a threat to American security.  The Munson Report which was issued on November 7, 1941 clearly indicated that AJAs were remarkably loyal to the United States.  Yet, these unfortunate men, women, and children were forced into these camps.  When U.S. military authroties asked these men to volunteer for very dangerous intelligence duty, they did so in spite of their most unfair circumstances. Harrington gives anecdotes of the heroism and effectiveness of the men who volunteered for both dangerous combat duty and intelligence work.  These men infiltrated Japanese units, gathered intelligence, and helped American POWs escape.  These AJAs did so at great personal risk.  They knew that if they were detected and captured, they would be tortured to death. The effectiveness of the AJA intelligence operatives is amazing.  These operatives knew when members of the Japanese officer corps visited their girlfriends and exactly where.  Such intelligence information enabled American pilots to attack the appartments and houses and destroying the Japanese officer corps. When the Americans wanted to attack part of the Aleutian Islands that the Japanese had previously captured, the AJAs' intelligence was so accurate, that they knew that less than ten Japanese soliders were there. General MacArthur openly admitted that the AJAs intelligence officers saved over a million American lives.  When some members of the Marine Corps and Navy refused to permit the AJAs on naval vessels, General MacArthur stopped this nonsense because he knew just how important the AJAs were. The AJAs not only distingusshed themselves in the Pacific, they also distingushed themselves in North Africa.  Some of the AJAs were among the first to see combat in North Africa in 1942.  The AJA Unit known as the 442nd. rescued a unit from Texas in France or Italy.  The Germans had these Texans trapped, and the Army asked for volunteers to rescue these men.  Harrington gives a good description of the AJAs of the 442nd. successfully rescuing these troops from Texas.  Readers should note that the AJAs in the 442nd. had more casualties than men they rescued. Readers should also that proportionally the AJAs were the most highly decorated American units during World War II.  These men took great risks while their wives, children, parents, and other relatives were in concentration camps in the U.S.  Readers may know that some of these men were given The Congressinal Medal of Honor (some posthumously)as their courage was fully recognized due to anti-Japanese nonsense. Joseph Harrington wrote a solid book on a neglected part of U.S.  History.  Much of the heroism of the AJAs has been neglected or dismissed by \"mainstream\" historians.  Yet, Mr. Harrington cites documents and shows that the AJAs were vital for U.S. military intelligence during World War II.  There is little record of such historical work, and Mr. Harrington's book is a good place to start.</td><td>Challenging the Establishment Version of Anything is a Civic Responsibility \"and Great Fun\"</td><td>2006-08-23</td><td>632</td><td>2006</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>67000898</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>2016-09-20</td><td>A1AETKHEC2BZOB</td><td>1517453488</td><td>Glenn Soucy</td><td>An interesting tale with vampires and super vampires where heroes have magical swords packed with power.</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>2016-09-20</td><td>16</td><td>2016</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>67000899</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2014-01-16</td><td>A36GHT6ICUV5L0</td><td>B00AVAA85Q</td><td>Vernon Bradley, M.

Scripture understanding can only be completed when one understands the culture it was written and as well as the grammar nuances that very few individuals have.  As a wise person once said, if it doesn't say to you what it said to those it was intended for, you have a different gospel (paraphrased). Most people, from the pulpit down, unfortunately, try to teach with a bible on one hand and a Strong's in the other, with NO understanding of the culture of the day or the grammar that was in use of the day.  They also fail to comprehend that the 'exhaustive' of Strong's was meant to refer to the words extracted from Scripture (although not so much any more).  The definitions are by no means 'exhaustive' and Strong's intended audience had an understanding of the languages, at least.  (and, again, not so much AT ALL any more). Once you get it, trying to converse with those that don't, is impossible (in my experience).

My father and his siblings were refugees from Hitler's Germany, and they spoke their native tongue all their lives. When I read \"The Radetzsky March\" in English, I thought I could hear how some passages might read in German. I imagined certain words and phrases and was convinced I'd guessed them accurately. I bought the book to read, in a stumbling way and with a dictionary, and had quite a big surprise. Roth wrote in what my father called \"Hoch Deutsch\" -- very high-level, literary German. The phrases I'd imagined spoken in the \"kitchen German\" of my childhood turned out very different indeed. Example: when Col. Festetics and Lt. Zschosch are running down the absent Count Chojnicki, a servant suddenly appears and announces the Count in person. The translation reads, \"A fabulous fellow!\" I was sure that absolutely had to be \"Ein fabelhafter Kerl!\" Ach, nein. What Roth wrote was \"Famoser Bursche!\" I knew the adjective, of course, but never heard \"Bursche\" before. Perhaps it's Austrian? Anyway, from what I can grasp of the German edition the novel is just as amazing as in translation. An absolutely immortal work. Anybody interested in WWI, or 20th century history, or Austria-Hungary, or just a coruscating and mesmerizing read, should check out \"The Radetzsky March\" in the language of his or her choice.</td><td>Ausgezeichnet</td><td>2012-10-01</td><td>232</td><td>2012</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>67000903</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>2014-12-02</td><td>A1YQ8GTF7X8V13</td><td>1497396085</td><td>Zapple</td><td>A splendid collection of short stories, some a little paranormal and others deal with the supernatural but all told magically by Karen Black - who has a real 'supernatural' gift for storytelling.

I liked how Dovan was brought back into the story at an unexpected time and how he ended up playing an integral role in her life. This is not a romance in the sense of the other vampire stories. It is more of a drama, the telling of an interesting life from the viewpoint of someone who has seen it all happen throughout the eons of time. As interesting as it was, I did find myself checking my kindle often to see how far I am in the book. It is fairly lengthy and the pacing is smooth and steady throughout the entire story.

The first is who killed Reggie and Letitia so they became ghosts and the second is why is someone trying to break into the house and damage it now when it is being renovated? I enjoyed the story and the character development.  I was disappointed that there were so many errors. But, I would recommend the book to someone who likes a mystery with paranormal overtones.  And there is the romance.  The 2 main characters, Anna and BJ have a strong attraction to one another immediately, and it grows as the story progresses.  Two secondary characters, also begin a relationship, so there is romance all over the place. The book is one you can like, but be prepared to deal with errors.

In Last Dance, Mary Bennet comes into her own and learns to be true to herself with the unwanted help of Aunt Phillips.  And what a lovely surprise this brings. Not Romantic makes Charlotte Lucas the heroine giving her a backstory and personality that I found engaging.  And don't hit me, but I like Mr. Collins a little in this one.  He had a little puppy dog cute going on alongside his moments of boorishness. Sweet Ginger was adorable.  I loved that Harriet Smith from Emma got her own story.  She was a sweetie and I liked the innocent and gentle courtship with Robert Martin. All in all, this was a bevy of adorable stories that left a smile on my face and warmed the heart.

In this case, he traces the rising and falling fortunes of an immigrant family, generation by generation. This isn't a happy story - Helen, for example, lives out a heartbreaking episode. It examines the falsehoods the prop up so many images of American success; very few people act as a feeling reader might wish. And, in many cases, death comes much too easily. Eisner focuses on the community of Jewish immigrants. A naive reader might think of this as anti-Semitic, because of the prejudices and bad behavior of so many Jewish characters in this story. Quite the opposite, I think Eisner has a deep fondness and respect for these characters, even when they're not acting very respectable. Bad behavior isn't unique to any one group in this country, or even that much worse in one group than in another, most times. The dark side of cultural history needs to be told too, so I'm glad it's told with Eisner's underlying sensitivity. His iconic visual style works well in this story. I have to admit, I'm not a great fan of the look - it's a little \"cartoony\" for my taste. That doesn't get in the way of appreciating the strength of his style, or of the emotional and social complexity of Eisner's stories. I recommend this to anyone looking a bit beyond the bam-pow genre of graphic novels, and especially to readers who doubt that graphic novels represent real literature.

It is available as an eBook in the Kindle edition and via other sources as well. Never have I been so glad to be a part of the Internet community. Although it is the newest part of a successful series  of Arty Jewelry books by Sharilyn Miller, it stands on its own and is completely packed with fresh inspiration. Sharilyn Miller is  possibly the most well-known jewelry designer and teacher in the wire-wrapping arena. She is the original \"Wild Wire Woman\" and has taught countless others how to branch out and break through their creative barriers. If you haven't met her yet, have you got a treat in store for you! It doesn't matter that this book, Arty Jewelry IV , is a part of a series.  I would recommend that you read every single thing Sharilyn has written (I have!)  but you don't have to go in order. This book is her most recent. It is remarkable that she never repeats herself. Her outstanding use of excellent step by step photos coupled with  carefully written instructions, tips and cautionary safety advice, combine to make the reader's experience one in which he or she feels as if she is taking a personal course with the author. I learned several new things which have been on my mind ever since I started making jewelry. One goes back really far. I have felt so guilty about being such a loser. It is all about how to treat jewelry saw blades. Thank you, Sharilyn, for absolving me from thinking I was an idiot  when I was snapping all those jewelry saw blades by giving me one simple tip in this book.  Bless you for that! Do not think that because this is an eBook you will be \"shorted\" in any way. There are dozens and dozens of totally  beautiful and very explanatory photos. The instructions are of the highest quality, as I previously stated. When Sharilyn Miller is teaching you, whether you are at home reading, or sitting next to her, you are being taught by the best. The projects are amazing in this book.  You are led gradually to them by viewing some information on materials you will require, basic tools, techniques which are in the book, components you will need,  as well as something which is a project, to my mind, in and of itself. That is: how to make enameled headpins! I was so excited by the idea that I was going to learn to make enameled headpins I almost jumped out of my seat! I love enameled headpins. The author also teaches the reader how to choose wire, work harden it, and clean it.  She teaches you etching, knotless netting, how to sculpt, how to anneal 8 gauge wire, how to engrave and more! In this book she uses dead soft wire (always her preference) in various gauges. Her wire choices are copper (great, because it isn't expensive) and sterling silver, which she uses less of. She also mentions fine silver. That is excellent for making headpins because you have far less firescale to deal with. You do not have to only follow her lead  however. She encourages her readers to make choices on their own. Curiosity is a great impetus for creativity. There are nine breathtaking projects. As is usual with a Sharilyn Miller book, one project will have aspects which then opens the door to the next project.  It is very cool how the reader learns something seemingly easy, such as  the enchanting \"Winged Things Earrings\", the first project in the book (which has a variation pictured which is it just as adorable), and then progresses on to something slightly more complex.  This reviewer does not know of any other jewelry designer who goes from project to project in this manner this as seamlessly as Sharilyn Miller.  It is as if the reader gets to have an \"aha!\" moment during every single project.  It is never challenging, in the sense that she makes you bite off more than you can chew...rather, it is enticing and always FUN. Why make jewelry if it isn't fun?  I cannot think of a reason! Another fact which one must accept is that the author doesn't sell her jewelry. At least not here in New York. Therefore, if you love it, you MUST learn to make it. That is how I came to first know of this Sharilyn Miller. She had designed a bracelet which was haunting my dreams. It was on the cover of a magazine. This is so long ago I was a total newbie. I could barely distinguish a pair of chain nose pliers from a pair of round nose pliers. The bracelet she had designed was a heart bracelet of sterling wire and pearls.  I got the magazine. I followed her instructions, only changing the color of the pearls. Whenever I wore it, I got so many compliments on it, it was astounding. I have been a fan of Ms. Miller's ever since. You will be too, once you try even one of her projects. The projects in this book, Arty Jewelry IV, offer the reader pins, rings, earrings, bracelets and necklaces. All of them will be a total hit with you!  Ms. Miller doesn't just use wire, she uses leather, vintage buttons, buttons which are not vintage if you don't HAVE a vintage button,  vintage beads and other sorts of beads, dangles, and her great enameled headpins!  There are also all sorts of other surprises. I loved the Metallo de Fiore Bangle, and tried to take a photo of it. I couldn't believe it came so early in the book, but when you break down the instructions you will see that is in not a difficult  bracelet to make.  It is, on the other hand,  perfectly stunning and original. A variation of it, more delicate in sensibility , is also available for you to consider making. Either one is a wonderful bangle worthy of an art museum. I especially wish to point out that this project encompasses design basics  such as using graph paper, drawing a design and then copying it onto metal sheet, how to cut it out using shears and then a JEWELRY SAW  (thank you, Sharon! Now I can use one due to your advice) as well as using one's own designer eye for how you want your flower focal to look. You will be bending it and shaping it. From this point there is a project which teaches you to etch copper tubing and gives advice on where to get the tubing.  If I could have reached out and grabbed her beads with their simple and wonderfully primitive etched designs, I would have.  A necklace is made using these beads and a variety of other materials and it is great! The reader gets to see first hand how the author problem solves a number of ways in this project.  Very lovely project and very informative. There is a ton of depth to this project. As it employs leather, some vintage beads, and additional forms of knotting with other materials as well, it is extremely hip right now.  What an ingenious project. The earrings which follow, which use her enameled headpins in a most striking way, as well as the copper tubing, are a fabulous  addition. I don't want to make this review too long but I cannot leave out the Colorful Cage Bead Bracelet. How invigorating this joyous celebration of color is!  Wow!  Using earlier techniques, the reader is offered a project which is just a perfect rainbow of scintillating  color!  I felt like dropping everything and making that one Now, Now, NOW!  I defy you to resist it! The variation using leather to string it, and the earrings to go with it, are fab, too.  I think this is one of my favorites. This is also one where the author goes out of her way to mention safety concerns, which is much appreciated. She also gives credit where credit is due  while covering those concerns. If you make this bracelet, you will simply want one thing when it is finished: someone to direct you to the nearest party! The Vintage Button Brooch is next. It can also be made into a necklace. Another great project with a lovely photo to finish up. Following that are the rings made of sterling cutlery--I never knewwwwwww how that was done! How marvelous to know! I have always admired these sorts of rings and am going to make the family seek out an antiques sale, so I can pick up a vintage demitasse spoon or shrimp fork.  Love them! Nothing like repurposed vintage sterling made into something fun like an awesome ring! The author uses her \"Raw Silk\" textured hammer on the ring made from a spoon.  I must get that tool. You will see why when you read this book. It is so cool! These rings are so full of personality! From Vintage Chic to uber Modern, the reader is next treated to a chapter called \"Grungy Bangles\". To think I didn't know my other, other, other middle name was \"Grungy Bangles\"! This awesome project has you learning to anneal 8 gauge copper so that you can swirl and swoop it into divinely graceful arcs.  Then if you wish, you can embellish it in ways as suggested by the author.  You have to see it to believe it! Nobody does it better. Imagine my surprise to find that the final project revealed one more brand new as yet hidden level to author and designer Sharilyn Miller. It was brought to light for the author by a gift from a friend. I found this project so lovely, and so compelling. I don't want to spoil the surprise for the reader.  I can only tell you that if you make it, it will be passed down in your family for years to come and cherished as a gift from you to your loved ones as a showpiece of your ultimate, profound creativity, learned from the wonderful, life enhancing designer Sharilyn Miller. I urge you not to be without this book, Arty Jewelry IV.

Koetting guides the reader through all they need to effectively summon angels, demons, spirits and even gods. His outline for evocation is expertly written and easy to understand. He shows the reader that one doesn't need elaborate rituals and learn long recitations to summon any entity and tap into its power and use it to affect change in this world. He teaches that all that is required is to learn to tap into the divine and omnipotent in all of us. To correct the erroneous and ignorant statement from the negative reviewer Koetting's \"Become A Living God\" movement is not some televangelist movement. It is an instructional series to teach people the skills needed to make their life what they want it to be through the practice of magick. If the reviewer had spent time putting Koetting's teachings into practice instead of making assumptions he would know their efficiency and power.</td><td>Evoking Eternity: Mandatory reading for those who wish to summon spirits</td><td>2013-02-10</td><td>166</td><td>2013</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>67000924</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>2015-05-18</td><td>A7IPMCIEVFPXH</td><td>346898135X</td><td>Maggie Bailey</td><td>Great resource, and so handy.</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>2015-05-18</td><td>5</td><td>2015</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>67000925</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>2015-06-26</td><td>AHAF1XBPOMBAD</td><td>1849143072</td><td>Aviva</td><td>Very short and original little volume of assorted musings.

Darren L. Parre takes us through 33 years in the life of Jack Mathis.  As a boy Jack dreamed of becoming a baseball player.  This is his story as it unfolds over the course of 33 summers.  Jack has to contend with several hardships in life including an abusive father and drug and alcohol use.  The author provides a character study entwined in a story that you want to keep reading.  We get to see Jack in many different lights - you will agree with, get angry at him, laugh with him and be happy and sad for him.  You really get a strong feel for the character. I really enjoyed the writing style.  Each chapter is a new year.  The reader gets to reminisce as Jack goes through some \"current\" events through the 80's and 90's.  That part was fun for me.  Each chapter also contains the baseball news for that year and of course Jack's story.  It was a great formula that I thoroughly enjoyed. 33 Summer is about struggle and hardship and what it takes to make a dream.

The story deals with a couple's navigation of: finding each other, their new marriage, and the Civil War's onset as well as the more localized conflict between the Dakota Sioux Indians and the American settlers. The novel's name, Sky Tinted Water, comes from the Dakotan version of Minnesota and is Part 1of a series. Part 2, Sky Dance, is being released March 2013. This story revolves around Rory, who was orphaned at 7 years of age and raised by her older sister, Isabelle Caldwell. The Caldwells and their eight children move to Minnesota after a family tragedy and bring Rory with them. Rory, more or less, stumbles upon the love of her life the first day the family settles in the town of Guilford. We see her finding love, marrying, becoming pregnant and agonizing over the inevitability of her husband, Dawson, enlisting as a Union soldier. It's easy to see why this is labeled a \"sweet historical novel.\" Rory and Dawson' relationship progressed very smoothly with very little angst (that was supplied by the other story lines). How they reacted and interacted with each other was touching as evidenced by Dawson's response after his first conversation with Rory and a letter Dawson wrote Rory from the battlefield, to name a few examples. I really enjoyed this novel. It contains romance, humor, conflict, and action. The author gives great insight into the characters' personal lives as well as how they're affected by the controversies of their day. The only issue I had was the initial response (especially Rory's) to a potentially dangerous threat close to home.

Set in Portland and Falmouth on Maine's craggy coastline, Fatal Whispers will sweep you away by its wealth of intriguing suspects and breathtaking action. You'll be guessing to the last page of this nail-biter. Megan Scott travels with Michael Elliott to Portland, Maine where they stay with Bianca, Megan's cousin. Michael, an investigative reporter has been assigned to uncover the facts surrounding the strange death of a woman living rough. The woman is well-known to residents as Glad Rags Gladys and she is found dead from a mysterious substance close to Bianca's flower shop. Events take off and very soon there are three murders. The book is a fascinating mystery. It's about the logical steps taken to unravel the puzzle of three seemingly benign and unrelated deaths, and we meet some engaging characters on the way as they struggle to stay alive--Megan's cousin, Bianca and her husband, Victor, and George are among my favorites, along with the setting which has such a strong presence in the book that it's a character. But the book is also about the relationship of Megan Scott with Michael Elliott and her gnawing back and forth. As a recent widow, should she become romantically involved with another man, Michael, so soon after her husband's death? I must add that I loved Bianca's flower shop where much of the action takes place. And the final scenes brought me to the edge of my seat as Megan and Michael realize a deadly killer is on the loose. If you like action-packed mystery and thrillers with characters who grow as they come to grips with what is happening to their relatives and friends before there are more murders, you will love Fatal Whispers, the second book in the Megan Scott and Michael Elliott series.</td><td>A Mesmerizing, Action-Packed Mystery</td><td>2013-08-31</td><td>330</td><td>2013</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>67000938</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>2012-01-05</td><td>A1DXK2Y4A50O5H</td><td>B005EJ3OPA</td><td>horrorgirldonna</td><td>The Between Years hooked me from page one.

While continuing to work as a screenwriter, in 2016 alone Fracassi has released two novelettes, Altar and Mother, to critical acclaim, as well as contributing short stories to various venues. Here we take a look at his most recent release, Fragile Dreams. The story opens with our protagonist, Matthew, arriving at the offices of Baskin and Associates, a law firm, in desperate need of employment. After spending just a couple of pages in Matthews head, we are firmly in his corner, wishing him only the best for the job interview ahead, a daunting position that most readers will have experienced at some point. But this is a horror story, so we are always weary of the story taking a turn for the worse. We are not always sure of where the story is going or how it is going to end, or even if what Matthew is experiencing is a horrifyingly dark reality or the hallucinations of a dying mind, but thanks to the wonderful writing talent and dark imagination of the author, we are guaranteed a suspenseful and terrifying trip.

It's the first book in a series, and the ending is a rather massive cliffhanger. The story is an original take on a popular YA paranormal creature, vampires. It's a tale of self-discovery and change set in a gritty urban environment. Kaeden Parish is a normal teenager, graduating high school and preparing for his future. One night changes all of that, and he's thrust into a paranormal world he didn't know existed. Kaeden is very loyal to family and friends, willing to risk just about anything for them. Following Kaeden as he becomes what he considers a monster is fascinating. It's funny how we deny the things that are right in front of us out of some last ditch grasp at humanity (and sanity). There are so many interesting characters in this novel. I absolutely loved Caleb, there was just something about his character than I found intriguing. Kaeden's girlfriend, Genesis, is a perfect foil for him. My favorite parts of the novel were the interactions between the characters, especially the dialogue. The descriptions were so in depth that I sometimes felt a bit mired and started skimming. Though, they also help pull the reader into this strange underworld. I recommend Cerberus to everyone high school and up that enjoys a dark YA paranormal story. The novel does contain graphic violence and gore, so if that's not your thing, you may want to pass. As I stated earlier, this ends in a cliffhanger that will leave the reader begging for the next book.

It's an excellent and entertaining sequel to Those Poor, Poor Bastards. I have to admit that I'm difficult to please when it comes to western novels, but weird western novels are my kind of novels. In my opinion The Ten Thousand Things is - just like Those Poor, Poor Bastards - an excellent example of a good and entertaining weird western novel, because the authors know how to entertain their readers. To be honest, I was impressed by this novel, because it turned out to be an even better novel than its predecessor. Before I begin to analyze the contents of this novel, it's good to mention that it's recommendable to read Those Poor, Poor Bastards before reading this novel. In my opinion knowledge of the previous happenings is essential in order to fully understand what happens in this novel. Here's a bit of information about the story: In The Ten Thousand Things Nina Weaver and the people with her are riding the rails and fight against Liao Xu's zombies. Liao Xu is responsible for unleashing the horde of the deaduns and other creatures against them. He relentlessly pursues them, because he wants something from them... The Ten Thousand Things differs a bit from the first novel, because it brings more depth to the story. The first novel introduced the characters to the readers and now the authors begin to add depth and more details to the story and to the characters. For example, the authors reveal a few interesting things about Liao Xu and his past, and Nina begins to accept her abilities and experiences sexual awakening. The authors also tell what happened to James' family. Nina is a fascinating heroine, because she's almost like a female version of the male western heroes and rogues played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and other famous actors. Although she's a fighter and survivor, she's much more than that, because she has strange abilities that separate her from others. She has a spiritual connection to the People and the Land. She has slowly begun to change inside, because she hears the sounds of the People, their drums and flutes, and their whispers. The realization of this change rattles her, because she has to accept the changes. There are several excellent and thrilling scenes in this novel. For example, the attack of the birds is an impressive scene. Reading about Liao Xu's demon train is also memorable, because it adds a wonderfully otherwordly atmosphere and a malicious supernatural threat to the storyline. The prose in The Ten Thousand Things is surprisingly good (in the first novel the prose was good, but now it's even better). The authors have found the right kind of rhythm and  that they use to move the happenings forward. The pacing is also much better in this novel, because the story feels more balanced than before. One of the best things about this novel (and its predecessor) is that it's genuinely interesting to read about how Nina and the other survivors get along with each other. The authors have managed to write about this aspect of their survival in a surprisingly realistic way. The authors write boldly about sex and things related to sex. I won't reveal what happens in the story, but there's an explicit and passionate sex scene in the middle of the novel that has been written well. It's nice that there's also a bit of humour in the story. For example, the scene in which one of the characters has to drop his pants is a funny scene. I think it'll amuse several readers. Because I'm a Finn, I have to mention that it was interesting that the authors used one Finnish word and a few Swedish words in the story. These words surprised me, because I didn't expect to find Finnish and Swedish words in a weird western novel. It's possible that there are readers out there who think that this series is only about a fight against zombies. I can say to these readers that they're wrong, because the authors have created a story that tells of an epic and desperate fight between good and evil. There are - of course - plenty of zombies in this series, but there's much more to the story than them, because the fight between good and evil is the core of the story. Tim Marquitz, J. M. Martin and Kenny Soward have written an exciting and gory tale that will please fans of zombie stories and weird western novels. I'm sure that the viewers of The Walking and Hell on Wheels will also love The Ten Thousand Things, because this novel is almost like a combination of The Walking Dead and Hell on Wheels. If you're interested in zombie stories and weird western novels, The Ten Thousand Things is the novel to read, because the authors deliver a fantastically gory and entertaining story that's full of action. If you like zombie stories, please take a look at this novel, because it's an enjoyable novel.

It is only 141 pages and I read it in one sitting. It only took me two-three hours of my life, and afterwards I felt like I had just been through a traumatic event. I felt like I needed a hug. Paiges friend Robin is kidnapped. Paige is not the only witness, but Paige is the only one left behind in the aftermath. Paige tries not to think about what happened, but everywhere she goes she is reminded of what could have been for Robin. We see Paige try to get past what has happened. Paige is young and it is a small town, so she cant forget. People look at Paige differently, even Robins boyfriend takes on a new role in Paiges life. We meet several instrumental characters not only in Paiges life but also people important for the case against the kidnapper. This isn't a who done it, we know right away most of what happened. This book explores the repercussions for Paige. The focus of the books is not the family, or the school, but how this disappearance affects the best friend, and a young girl at that. Paiges story is told going backwards one year at a time starting with Paiges sophomore year in high school and ending one year before the incident. The story itself is written well enough that I couldn't put it down. When I was about sixteen pages in I felt like crying (and every thirty pages after I felt like giving her the hug that she probably so desperately needed). The subject of the book and Paiges struggles come at you slowly, as you realize that what she went through, and what shes going through, is more than meets the eye. Since the book is written backwards, we see a regression of maturity of the main character. It affects the way the story is told and the worldviews of the protagonist. I have to say that the way it was written was unique, I have never seen this done before. Although this book was pretty serious, I found it very entertaining. This book just didn't have a super satisfying ending. But it does give some sort of starting point, a base line to show how everything was before the incident happened, what her relationship was like with her friends and family.

The character dialogue was very well done.  The descriptions were excellent.  The pacing was quite good.  What makes a potentially great writer is all there BUT....  The story itself was told simplistically as if reciting a children's bedtime story.  The problems and solutions were laid out Without any wonder or mystery for the reader.  The characters themselves did little to work hard to arrive at solutions.  Every story and every main character in a story should have an arc.  A profound change, overcoming profound difficulties and problems to become something better and different.  The arc itself here existed, but the characters had little to do, little to solve, little to overcome.  It was all too easy for the characters to change, fall in love, discover their abilities, win the day.  The author has the right elements, but it comes across as two dimensional.  Flat.  Joe is a protector.  Joe gets his power from the source.  Joe has the insight during the crucial battle that his power can be increased if he imagines it as a cloud computer.  Wow joes geek thinking saves he world.  Joe has the hots for a fire elemental called ember.  Woo original.  See the problem is that it's the equivalent of see spot run.  Spot loves his owner.

The setting and the dysfunctionality has a strong resemblance to books like Nora Roberts and Jackie Collins.

Emmy is so down-to-earth. Spunky. Gutsy. Honest. I could so identify with her. I think in high school, I was a lot like her. Jack was larger than life. He had stage presence, and his personality practically dripped off the pages. I normally hate love triangles: (1) I'm a one-man kind of girl and can't identify with a girl who can't make up her mind and (2) the girl never picks the guy I like and (3) they are overused. But I didn't mind the triangle in this book. I knew who she'd end up with and it would definitely be the guy I liked. And second, it wasn't that she couldn't make up her mind as to what she wanted. It was more how she was going to make what she wanted happen. I've already started stalking the author and reading reviews for the next book.

She did not use it for one or two characters to insinuate that they were less than civilized, but instead sprinkled it through the books as if that was the only way to relate to her male audience.  She might like to consider that men are just as mentally capable as women.  They are not all just a bunch of sniggering adolescents; far from it if they are avid readers...  If she is truly unable to think well enough to avoid that sort of patronizing drivel, maybe it would help if she perused some of Heinlein's work or something along the lines of  \"Kushiel Dart\" to see how it can be incorporated into a story while still respecting her audience, rather than leaving the impression that she has thrown a pile of smelly garbage into the middle of a living room, so to speak.

But it left a strong impression on me and I reread the series every couple of years. Luke is a flawed character.  He is unable to express his feelings to those he cares about, so he comes across as aloof and uncaring.  For him, though, actions speak louder than words and loyalty and honor matter more than anything else.  His devotion to Hans is a key example, even when that devotion can cost him personally and politically (i.e. when he elevates Hans to captain).  At the same time, anyone who betrays his loyalty drives him to seek revenge, no matter the consequences.  There are both Macbeth and Hamlet qualities about him. I appreciate the stark language of the series, and how each one builds substantially off the one before it.  Whoever was the editor did an excellent job, as these books contain little fat.  Overall, I think this trilogy is a masterpiece and I would like to see it reprinted in the US.

A favourite of mine is Tung. He's illiterate, inept, can't get to grips with the modern world - he makes me feel good about myself! He has depths though and the team would be totally lost without him. There's a huge conspiracy by the Black Magicians to take over the world and ensure that evil reigns. Just a few good men (and an elderly wizard and an inept illiterate) stand in their way. This is a hugely funny book. Ken Magee's sense of humour shines out through the story and leaves the reader with some beautifully memorable phrases. It's not often that I've encountered the Universe as a character.

Over the years Dennis Patterson has been recognized for his commitment to excellence and outstanding work performance.  For the past 10 years  he was an ETHICS OFFICER and Manager of the EMPLOYEE CONCERNS PROGRAM at the (INL) near Idaho Falls, Idaho. BATTELLE ENERGY ALLIANCE (BEA) is the operating contractor for the U.S. Department of Energys Idaho  National Laboratory. The INLS vision to become a world-class nuclear laboratory by 2015 would ensure continued growth in the area. An employee came to Dennis Patterson  with a problem that was within the scope of the ETHICS OFFICERS  job  description.  This was a situation that could have and should have been resolved in a day or two, with a few meetings between the appropriate personnel, and problem solved. That would be too easy. Instead Dennis Patterson versus the  INL (David vs Goliath) spent 4 years and thousands of dollars fighting a legal battle that ended with Dennis Prevailing and the employee with the initial problem getting his job back. Dennis was doing his job as the Ethics Officer and soon He became the Bad Guy. Here are a few quotes from the book: His (Dennis Patterson) job title was changed from Manager to Specialist along with a $2,000.00 Salary Reduction. October 16, 2006  SUSPENSION WITHOUT PAY The Guard took my badge, cell phone and the key to my office. Management has decided to remove you from the Employee Concerns/ Ethics Office. Dennis was reassigned to a new job called ENGINEERING SERVICES. Dennis told his new boss I have zero engineering experience and my degree is in business. June 28, 2008 Dennis Won; My heart felt like it was going to burst and I was grinning ear to ear. Its not over,  BEA  is  Appealing  DOES  decision. DOE denied BEAS Appeal in its entirety. Dennis: WE WON It was exhilarating to read that BEA had lost on ALL SIXTY of their alleged arguments of Hearing Officer error. Dennis got a New Job not the Ethics Officers job he held for the past 10 years. However the New Job had the responsibility for developing a Manager Workshop and leading a new Laboratory Initiative to measure and Improve employee engagement. In Chapter 51 Dennis acknowledges the AMERICAN  ENGINEERING ALLIANCE (A.E.A.) of New York.  The web page is provided for A.E.A.  www.aeaworld.org  along with the VANGUARD AWARD presented to me on  April 21, 1999. Chapter 59 Highlights a WHISTLEBLOWER SUMMIT in Eastern Idaho when five Whistleblowers  each  told their stories and a photo of the group is provided. We were very fortunate to have Roger Boisjoly in attendance who told about his trials regarding the Challenger Disaster and how his life and family were affected in such a negative way. There are many similarities between the Dennis Patterson case and the Ed Turner case. Both Cases involving much legal maneuvering  continued for 4 years.  Dennis had outside support from National Leaders, Expert Legal advice, family, friends and his faith in God. The support for the Ed Turner case was primarily from  the AMERICAN ENGINEERING ALLIANCE, Family, Friends and his  faith in God. This book is so important for anyone contemplating being a Whistleblower. When you witness wrongdoing in Industry, Government, or the private sector where Public Health and Safety is involved  or financial wrongdoing is involved your INTEGRITY is at stake. If you cannot decide what to do, this book will help you make the Right Decision. This book clearly shows that one person fighting for the Truth against a large corporation can Prevail. That Person must Stay the Course, cannot give in, and cannot give up. That person  is Dennis Patterson. Remember, when you look in the Mirror each day. Be proud of your reflection.

Shortly thereafter, Martin Luther King is assassinated and riots break out. Duprey dies. Thirty-nine years later, Professor Malcolm Duprey has been murdered in Fort Worth, Texas, while he was there attending a conference. Detective Caleb Shepherd is assigned the case. Initially, it is thought that Duprey died as a result of mistaken identity by the local drug dealers. Shepherd soon discovers that Duprey and his colleague, Wilson, at Howard University had put together an algorithm for a company competing for a contract with Homeland Security. Without Duprey, the other competitor had a distinct advantage. The day Duprey met his demise he had been doing research at an oil exploration museum. The administrator there seems to be overly interested in the case. As Shepherd dwells deeper into the crime, he discovers that Dupreys father, Professor Roger Duprey, was killed 39 years earlier. At that time, his death was pinned on the riots caused by unrest in the black community after the killing of Martin Luther King. When Shepherd requests the files, he finds there isn't any info that would indicate a proper investigation had been completed. Shepherd speculates if there could be a connection. As the story unfolds, Shepherd unearths sordid details and the suspects continue to mount. This is a well-crafted crime story full of twists and turns that kept me turning the pages to find out who were the culprits in the murders of both Malcolm Duprey and his father 39 years earlier.

She does everything \"right,\" including making good grades, having great manners, and performing for her mother's friends on demand.  It's never enough, and she wonders if will ever be.  On the other hand, her father and her brother love Angela with intensity.  They are doting and protective, never allowing her mother's vile nature to break her.  The contrast in these relationships sets the tone for the events that carry Angela into high school and into dating relationships.  Her best friends, Trudy and Lisa, are there when she meets her first love, Jacob.  The rollercoaster of their high school relationships carries on through college, and some of the bonds remain intact. There is great writing here, such that readers will remain interested throughout.

When we prepare meals, we keep our plates warm in the oven and continue to add additional items to the plates so that everything stays hot for when it's time to serve our meals. By the time everything is ready, the plates are too hot to take out of the oven with bare hands. Big mitts are too bulky for me to get a good grip on regular plates from the oven, plus I don't particularly like them touching the plate surface or food on the plates. So I usually use a clean towel- which can be precarious. This Cuisinart mini oven mitt is absolutely perfect for removing hot plates with food from the oven- it provides protection against the heat (up to 450 degrees), and it gives me a secure grip of the edge of the plate due to a less bulky, good fit and the nonslip ridges that come in contact with the plate. Plus, it's absolutely fine if this mini mitt touches the plating surface or even brushes up against prepared food as it's so easy to hand wash and keep clean. What's really cool too is that the mitt stands up, so the grip portion stays totally clean (as opposed to if I laid it on the counter). This mini mitt is good for other uses too, like grabbing hot potatoes from the oven, removing things like cookie sheets where I'm just grabbing the edge of bakeware, and handling a hot skillet handle on the stove. Of course, there are times I still need fuller coverage, but this mini mitt is perfect for daily use in my home. Plus, it hardly takes any storage space in our drawer, though with how useful it is it's highly unlikely to ever be stowed away. I'm really impressed and give it five stars. 5/28/16: I'm so happy with the mini mitts that I've purchased two at full price. I think these are a super useful product that I use almost everyday.</td><td>Hand Washable And A Perfect Design For Removing Hot Plates And Other Items From The Oven</td><td>2016-05-07</td><td>343</td><td>2016</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>67000998</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>2016-01-24</td><td>A1RJDG0BXW7LHP</td><td>B00RUD4FMY</td><td>Definitive</td><td>It was a curious but interesting plot and worth four stars.
